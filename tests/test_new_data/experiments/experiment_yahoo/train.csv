"religious ppl pray! what do they say? hello!\nif u pray God perhaps u use some sentences or phrases to pray him!\ncan u tell me what do u say to God.\nThanx\n&\nPeace Whenever I pray I just speak from my heart. He already knows how you feel so just talk to him. I usually thank him for everything he has done for me and ask him to forgive me of my sins. Of course there is more, but I think the best way to pray is to say how you truly feel. There is no need to be ashamed. Try it for yourself and see.",society_culture
"Please honestly share - What was the craziest thing you ever did during your entire life? Okay - it's only fair that I share my experience first.  As a child vacationing in downtown Pittsburg PA with my family, we were in the audience of a television game show.  We were asked to write down ""the craziest thing we could think of doing"" and submit it at one point early in the program.  I remembered seeing a large landscaped water fountain in a courtyard outside the studio.  My answer was to ""go skinny-dipping in that fountain.""  Was I ever shocked and so totally embarrassed when they called out my name later in the program?  Oh, yes!  Someone had to literally take me by the arm and drag me up on the stage and into the camera's view, but it was worth the silver dollar I won.  BTW - I never did go skinny-dipping in that fountain.

"Does susquatch really exist ? This is a fasinating subject for , I may go in search of - over the summer ! Bigfoot, (also known as Sasquatch), is the name of a phenomenon which has polarised people around the world, being either the product of vivid imagination or a creature that has somehow avoided close observation or capture by man.\n\nBigfoot is described as a large, bipedal hairy humanoid creature living in remote wilderness areas of the United States and Canada, specifically those in southwestern Canada, the Great Lakes, the Pacific Northwest, the Rocky Mountains, the forests of the U.S. Northeast, and the U.S. Southern states. Some claim it is a creature which may be found around the world under different regional names, such as the Yeti, or is at least a closely related species. Sightings have allegedly occurred in Malaysia, China, Russia, Australia, South America and Hawaii. [1] [2] [3]\n\nThe majority of scientists reject the possibility of the creature's existence, and consider the stories of Bigfoot to be a combination of unsubstantiated folklore and hoax. This is due to current scientific knowledge plus the lack of bones or a body.\n\n\nI believe it, the earth is still undiscovered. So there are things that go bump in the night.",society_culture

"Christians, what do you think about this dream I had last night? A man was driving west through Arizona on an interstate highway when he looked at his dashboard and saw he was almost out of gas.  There were no roadside stations in sight but he needed gas very soon.  The next exit was for a small town about 3 miles off the interstate so he took the exit to find gas.  It was a cold, wet, windy, winter day and as he traveled down the road to the little town he noticed a young man walking on the side of the road toward the interstate.  With little concern he traveled on to the town and filled up his tank.  \n\nAs he turned and drove back to the interstate he came upon the young  man again.  He was wearing a light jacket holding his arms close to his chest leaning forward into the freezing wind and rain obviously miserable and cold.  As the car approached the young man on the road he just barely put out his left thumb so as to indicate he needed a lift but trying to maintain some body heat.\n\nAs the driver passed by the young  man something inside him told him to stop.  He had never before stopped to pick up anyone like this before.  He brought his car to a stop about a quarter mile down the road from the young man.  As he turned to look back through the rear windshield he could see the young man running down the road toward his car.  Soon the young man was standing at the passenger door looking in the through the window the driver had lowered.  \n\n“I sure could use a lift,” said the young man.  The driver asked,  “which way do you need to go?”  The young man replied, “I need to go east.  Are you going that way?”  The driver hesitated for just a moment and then said, “Yeah.  I’m going east.  Get in.”\n\nThe young man almost jumped into the car.  His hair was covered in ice and with the warmth of the car it began to melt and drip from his hair.  As the driver pulled onto the road heading back to the highway he asked the young man, “where do you need to go?”  He replied, “I’m trying to get to my dad’s house in Virginia”.  The driver said, “That’s a long way to hitch hike don’t you think?  Why didn’t you call you dad and get some help getting back home?”\n\nThe young man replied, “ I haven’t talked to my dad in 5 years.  I left home on bad terms with him.  I was doing some things I new I shouldn’t do and dad didn’t approve.  So I left and said I’m never coming back.  Now I’ve lost my job.  I’ve lost my girl friend.  I have no money, no friends, and no place to live.  I don’t have anything left and nowhere to go.  I was afraid to call him. What if he said no I can’t come home?  Then what would I do?  Where would I go?  I thought if I can just make it back home maybe I can walk up and knock on his door.  Tell him how sorry I am.  Maybe he would let me come home.”\n\nThe driver pulled his car onto the interstate and headed east retracing the path from which he had just come.  The two continued to talk about what had happened in the young man’s life.  \n\nAs they drove and talked they soon came to a large city.  The driver without saying why began following the signs that showed the way to the airport.  The young man asked, “Where are we going.”  The driver responded, “I’m going to pay for a ticket for you to fly home.  You need to be with your dad.”  The two went into the airport together where the driver bought the ticket.  He handed it to the young man and said, “you’d better hurry you’re going to miss your flight.”  The young man hugged the driver and then with tears in his eyes he said, “You know, you didn’t have to do this, did you?”  \n\nThe driver paused for just a moment and looking back into the young man’s eyes responded, “ Yeah, I think I did.”\n\nI then found myself looking up a the crucified Jesus hanging on the cross looking down into my eyes.  I looked up at him acknowledging what He had done for me and with tears in my eyes I said, “You know, You didn’t have to do this, did You?”   \n\nJ Very nice dream.  Thanks for posting it.  The representation in the dream is very good.  We the human family through rebellion and disobedience left our Heavenly Father, just like the boy in this dream left his father.  We then often find ourselves in dire situations, and want our Heavenly Father to forgive us and help us just like this boy did.  Jesus then, just like the kind man in this dream, paid the price and ticket to made possible for us to be forgiven and get back to our Father. \n\n Father forgive us and teach us that truth that sets us free (John 8:32).",society_culture

Much earlier in stage history, when superstition had a less frightening hold on the craft, actors and their followers used a more gracious greeting: ""May you break your leg,"" by which it was meant that the evening's performance would be of such grandeur that the actor would be obliged to break his leg - that is bend his knee - in a deep bow acknowledging the audience's applause.",society_culture

Also known as a tongue Kiss, or Deep Kiss.\n\nWhile family members may sometimes kiss on the lips, a tongue kiss almost always indicates a romantic or sexual relationship. French kissing stimulates the lips, tongue and mouth, which are all areas very sensitive to touch. It is considered by many to be both very pleasurable and highly intimate. Unlike other forms of ""casual"" kissing (such as brief kisses of greeting or friendship), episodes of French kissing will often be prolonged, intense, and passionate. It may signal the beginning of a period of ""making out"" or sex. Because of the intimacy associated with it, in many regions of the world tongue kissing in public is not acceptable to most, particularly in the case of extended duration. See: public display of affection.\n\nIn a tongue kiss participants may exchange saliva, which would often be considered disgusting in other contexts, but which may add to the passion and excitement of the sexual kiss. Although most sexually-transmitted diseases are not transmitted by kissing, the exchange of saliva in a French kiss may increase the chances of catching an orally transmitted disease. Infectious Mononucleosis (American: Mononucleosis or, colloquially, ""mono""; European: Glandular Fever), a disease spread through saliva, is often colloquially referred to as ""the kissing disease.""",society_culture

"Given a function, how do you test for Horizontal Asymptotes...? ...before spending all the time to figure out what they are? The third answer above is close, but not quite right.  A function can have two different horizontal asymptotes -- one in the limit of +infinity, and the other in the limit of -infinity.  You need to check the values of both limits separately.  \n\nFor instance, the horizontal asymptotes of arctan(x) are +pi/2 (as x -> +infinity) and -pi/2 (as x -> -infinity).\n\nFor rational functions (functions that can be expressed as the ratio of two polynomials) there is an easy way to test for and find the horizontal asymptotes:\n\nLet  f(x) = p(x)/q(x) be a rational function. Then: \n\n1.    If (the degree of q(x))  > (the degree of p(x)) then there is one horizontal asymptote at 0.\n\n\n2.    If (the degree of q(x)) =  (the degree of p(x)) then there is one horizontal asymptote at the (leading coefficient of p(x))/(leading coefficient of q(x))\n\n\n3.

"How is solar energy beneficial to humans?  Solar energy is a success story. It already supplies electricity to several hundred thousand people around the world, provides employment for over ten thousand and generates business worth more than $1 billion dollars. In the future, the pace of change and progress could be even more rapid as the solar industry unlocks its hidden promise.\n\nThe benefits of solar power are compelling: environmental protection, economic growth, job creation, diversity of fuel supply and rapid deployment, as well as the global potential for technology transfer and innovation.\n\nThe underlying advantage of solar energy is that the fuel is free, abundant and inexhaustible. The total amount of energy irradiated from the sun to the earth’s surface is enough to provide more than 10,000 times the annual global energy consumption. Yet these benefits remain largely untapped; most energy decisions taken today overlook solar power as a modular technology which can be rapidly deployed to generate electricity close to the point of consumption. Phasing in solar photovoltaics therefore requires a shift from centralised to decentralised power production, offering far greater control to individual consumers.",science_mathematics

"Lenz's Law Demonstration - Magnetic Physicists Needed? When a magnet is dropped down a long coil no e.m.f is induced in the middle section as (to my understanding)although flux linkage is at the maximum there is no change in flux linkage so Faraday's Law gives an e.m.f of 0. however in the classic demonstration of a magnet being dropped down a copper pipe there is clearly and e.m.f being induced all the way down the pipe to opppose the motion so that it reaches a terminal velocity and takes longer than expected to come out of the other end of the pipe. Can anyone explain the difference in the coil to the pipe that causes the effect in the pipe but not the coil. Thanks. The difference is that the pipe allows for complete current loops around the circumference of the pipe, which will generate a magnetic field in opposition to the falling magnet.  In a coil, with the ends disconnected, you won't have this happening.  You induce some emf in the coil, but it's not a closed circuit, or at least not one that can generate a magnetic field opposing the falling magnet.  You could consider small current loops induced within the wire, or around the circumference of the wire, depending on the magnet's orientation, but these will be small and weak compared to a current loop all the way around a pipe.  However, if you wire one end of the coil to the other,  you should get some Lenz's law braking of the magnet.   \n\nIt's a very clever idea for a demonstration.  I had to go set it up and test it myself with some magnet wire wound around a glass tube and a glass tube sheathed in a copper pipe, to see the effect you described.  Like I said, if you connect the coil to itself, you will see some effect, but it's not nearly as strong as the copper tube.  I think this is because the emf is induced in the coil as a whole, and not as a local loop as in the pipe, so you have a field of the same total strength, but it's not as strong locally. I think I'm going to have to play around with this some more and maybe do some actual math to figure out the full details.",science_mathematics

Make sure the lens cover is off the tube of the telescope and nothing is blocking the eyepiece.  Once that's done, you're probably just WAY out of focus.  There should be a focusing knob near the eyepiece.  Start turning it in one direction - it might take a while before an image appears.  If it doesn't work after about a minute, start going back in the other direction.  This might be easier to do at night - if you point the out-of-focus telescope at a star, you should see a big fuzzy donut where the star should be (and a few lines through it if you have a reflector).

"Are gamma delta T cells involved in T cell activation?  Although gamma delta T cell receptor-bearing lymphocytes (gamma delta T cells) constitute a significant minority of circulating and tissue-associated T lymphocytes, the mechanism responsible for the activation of these cells is unknown. To address this question, resting gamma delta TCR+, CD3+, CD4-, CD8- cells isolated from the blood of healthy volunteers were cultured with allogeneic dendritic cells (DC) or monocytes, and their proliferative response measured. DC alone induced gamma delta T cells to proliferate, with a peak response on the sixth day of culture. Pretreatment of DC with an anti-HLA-DR mAb, but not anti-HLA class I or anti-CD1 mAbs, inhibited the response of gamma delta T cells. Antibodies to gamma delta T cell receptor, CD2, CD3, or CD11a were also inhibitory, whereas antibodies to alpha beta T cell receptor, CD4, CD5, and CD8 had no effect. Although only 40-60% of freshly isolated gamma delta T cells expressed CD28, mAbs directed against CD28 or its ligand, CD80, were markedly inhibitory. Moreover, removal of CD28+ cells from the gamma delta T cell population nearly abrogated the response to DC. These results demonstrate that resting gamma delta T cells recognize and respond to MHC class II determinants on allogeneic DC in a manner that is highly dependent on the CD28 activation pathway as well as molecules such as CD2 and CD11a that mediate cell-to-cell adhesion.",science_mathematics

If your referring to a black-out style outage where the issue was with a transformer, then there is no equation it is simply a outage where a piece of equipment called a transformer failed.  A transormer is simply a container with 2 coils of wire used to change or transform voltage from one level to another. If you have a power pole in your back yard , if you look at the top there is usually 1 or more ""cannisters"" with wires running from the power pole to the cannister to your house. That cannister is a transformer.  The power pole has anywhere from 2000-5000 volts on it and the transformer's job is to lower the voltage level down to either 240 VAC in europe and other countrys or 110 VAC here in the US.  This is called a step down transformer.  There are also others called step up transformers that raise the voltage from 110 up to levels as needed. \nNow, if that piece of equipment fails then no power can pass down the line and give you electricity in your house. If a large transformer that supplys power to the city fails,then that city (or portion of that city conected to that transformer) will receive no power until the transformer is fixed. \n\nFor a better explanation (or a clearer one ) read here:\nhttp://science.howstuffworks.com/power.htm",science_mathematics
"What is fractal dimension? How is it calculated? A common type of fractal dimension is the Hausdorff-Besicovich Dimension, but there are several different ways of computing fractal dimension.  \n\nRoughly, fractal dimension can be calculated by taking the limit of the quo-  \ntient of the log change in object size and the log change in measurement  \nscale, as the measurement scale approaches zero. The differences come in  \nwhat is exactly meant by ""object size"" and what is meant by ""measurement scale"" and how to get an average number out of many different parts of a  \ngeometrical object. Fractal dimensions quantify the static *geometry* of an object.  \n\nFor example, consider a straight line. Now blow up the line by a factor of two. The line is now twice as long as before. Log 2 / Log 2 = 1, corresponding to dimension 1. Consider a square. Now blow up the square by a factor of two. The square is now 4 times as large as before (i.e. 4 original squares can be placed on the original square). Log 4 / log 2 = 2, corresponding to dimension 2 for the square. Consider a snowflake curve formed by repeatedly replacing ___ with _/&#92;_, where each of the 4 new lines is 1/3 the length of the old line. Blowing up the snowflake curve by a factor of 3 results in a snowflake curve 4 times as large (one of the old snowflake curves can be placed on each of the 4 segments _/&#92;_).  \nLog 4 / log 3 = 1.261... Since the dimension 1.261 is larger than the  \ndimension 1 of the lines making up the curve, the snowflake curve is a fractal.",science_mathematics

The idea of uniformitarianism says that as things are happening today so they have always happened... well if that's the case, at the current rate of erosion, the highest mountains would be under water in less than 12 million years... so how is it that paleontologists are still digging up bones that are ""40 million years old"" and they're still above ground? You are misunderstanding a few different concepts here.  That is a pretty good definition of uniformitarianism...but it's important to understand that mountains are also building as they are eroding. An example of this is the Himalaya; they are sill rising about 3 inches every decade.  Hardly any erosion takes place on the higher peaks - too cold/covered in snow and ice.\n\nAlso, mountains build up in some areas, some areas erode, and many areas (of land) remain little changed (that's where you get your (relatively) young bones.

"whats the reason for chloroquine resistance in plasmodium falciparum?  This is for your parasitology class, right.\nBasically, resistance to elimination by the plasmodium falciparum parasite is due to giving insufficient doses to the patient, thus helping the parasite build up a resistance to the chloroquine.\n\nThis is something to worry about with any parasite using any anti-parasitic.  \n\nAny person administering anti-parasitics to a patient must calculate the dosage correctly to avoid resistance to treatment.\n\nCorrect weight/%/dose calculation will guarantee the parasite will be erradicated successfully.\n\nInterestingly, we have the same problem with cockroaches in our dwelling places, what?",science_mathematics
Why is the Heliconia Caribaea flower called Prince of Darkness? The Heliconia Caribaea flower is also known as the Balisier flower and grows in the tropics Heliconia caribaea is called Prince of Darkness because Growing about 16' ( 4.80 m ) high in full sun to light shade. Inflorescence consisting of 5 to 11 bracts. Bracts are red at base with thin yellow area along lip proximally. Red shading to dark red and almost black towards tip. Lower bract often green with some dark red at base. Dark colored areas on bracts become increasingly dark with age.,science_mathematics
"How do bessel functions relate to drums?  For circular membranes, the radial part of the vibrations is a bessell function while the angular part is an ordinary trigonometric function. This comes from writing the wave equation in polar coordinates and doing a separation of variables. The radial function turns out to satisfy Bessell's equation. The frequencies then turn out to correspond to the zeros of the bessell functions.",science_mathematics
