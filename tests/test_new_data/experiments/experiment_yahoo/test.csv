"What is the meaning of life?  to tell people this: I know that you can go to heaven if you get saved and the way that you get saved is if you believe that Jesus died on the cross from your sins, rose on the third day, and then you have to confess to God in prayer that you are a sinner and that you believe He died on the cross for your sins and ask for His forgiveness on your sins and it is THAT simple, salvation is a free gift, we can't earn it. I am a baptist who believes (let me rephrase that, I KNOW) that this stuff I said is true. My name is Matthew James Needham and don't be shy to contact me on this. my email address is im_proud2b_a_christian@yahoo.c...",society_culture
"This question is ONLY for Muslims...Please Read, I need help!!? Well, first off, I am a 23 yr old caucasian American girl who was born into Christianity. My whole entire life I have never felt a connection to Christianity and I have never been able to accept Jesus as my God. For the past 5 years now I have been researching Islam, reading the Qur'an and familiarizing myself with the Muslim religion. I feel that Islam is the religion for me, 100%. I, with all my heart, want to convert to Islam. However, I am afraid that I will not be accepted by Allah because of all the herendous sins I have commited in my considerably short life. Sins including drug use, being promiscuous, having a child out of wedlock, stealing and lying. I regret my sins so much that it makes me physically and mentally ill. I wish so much that I could be forgiven for my sins and live a pure life. So I guess what my questions are is, can I be a Muslim considering the horrible sins I have committed? Would a Muslim man be allowed to marry me? I am worthy of Islam? Please help me... I am going to be very blunt with you. Like it or not, your post made the hair on my arm stand on ends!\nThis is Hypocrisy at it is best.  You were born into a Christian family, lived you whole life as one, and yet you have lived your life as you pleased without any consideration to what you might do, and what might happen to you, and then you won't to convert to Islam, implying that your free life was caused by you being Christian not by what you have done.  Don't blame Christianity for your past life, and now you are looking for a way out!\n\nIf you truely regret your sinns, then you should confuse your sins to God and never do them again.  Not leave God, not abandon God, and pretend you are looking for the right path! you seem had never been on the right path.  And you are worried if a Muslim man will marry you! you better believe it, many will be happy to marry a convert to their faith.  After all, you have forsaken your religion for theirs.\n\nCan you be a Muslim? Yes you can. and don't forget that Muslims also sin, they are not far from sinning nor are they Angels, if that what you think.\nA Muslim man is allowed to marry you.  Don't put yourself down so much.  You sinned, so what, everyone sinned one time or another, some sinn more than other, but we all sin, inculding the Muslims, and those whom you think are worth more than you.  You sound as if you are begging for a Muslim man to marry you.  Look for a Good man, not just a muslim man. \n\nNow I am going to get it for this.  Islam is not worthy of you.  Help you!! God help those who help themselves.  If you ever been a christian then this blessing for you.  If you think Islam is 100% for you, then you should learn a little more of what you may go into.  \n\nIN the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy SPirit may you have peace in your heart, soul and spirit.  \nDon't forsaken your Lord who put his life on the line for you, and never forget his teaching.  Amen.\n\nADD:\nI regret posting this message to you, not because I don't believe in what I say, but because you will not hear my words.  I wish you well.  Muslims claim to say they believe in Jesus Christ, and at the same time, they don't give him the proper respect.  I know the muslims so well.  If you are really a christian! Islam is not for you, believe me.  But it is up to you.  Think hard, long and wise.  Finding a man to marry you, not so hard to do.  I say this to you with all respect.\n\nI like to ask you a question, if I may!\n\nThey tell you by converting to Islam that all your past sins will be forgiven?! Don't believe it.  the question.  How do he Muslims get their past sins forgiven!! do they convert to Christianity?  \nIn the time of the judgment day, Jesus Christ will be the one who will be judging you. Christians and Muslims believe he will return for the judgment day, not Muhammad, But Jesus Christ.  Ever wonder why it is Jesus and not Muhammad!  think about it, and you will know why.  Don't forget that.  \n\nTHINK HARD, LONG and be WISE.  and Good luck to you.\n\nWATCH THESE, AND IF YOU STILL THINK ISLAM IS GOOD FOR WOMEN, THEN GOOD LUCK TO YOU. AND MAY THE  LORD BE WITH YOU AND PROTECT YOU.\n\nYou study it for five yrs!   Beating the women or wife!  \nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp3Eam5FX58&mode=related&search=\nWife Beating in Islam - The Rules\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0nUI3TUdFCk&mode=related&search=\nDebate on Wife Beating as instructed in Quran\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWGA8i6scYY&mode=related&search=\nWife Beating in Islam - Only a rod will help!\n\nIf you want to convert and marry a muslim man, find a modern man, wo he will not look into his Quran and if he decided to beat you, his book will tell him it is fine, because he is the man, and his job is to teach you how to behave!\nP.S. I truely wish I didn't post this message, but I started, and I must finish what I start, at least this post.  Good Luck to you.\n\nMay the Lord Keep",society_culture

"how are the group number and the number of valence electrons of a representative element related to each other pls answer it right away!!!!! the number of electrons in the outermost  shell of an atom of an element , that is the valence shell electrons determines the group under which the element is placed.   since some atoms can have d same number of atoms in their outermost shell, it is only wise 2 place them under the same group. though the number of their electron shells vary.",science_mathematics
