"religious ppl pray! what do they say? hello!\nif u pray God perhaps u use some sentences or phrases to pray him!\ncan u tell me what do u say to God.\nThanx\n&\nPeace Whenever I pray I just speak from my heart. He already knows how you feel so just talk to him. I usually thank him for everything he has done for me and ask him to forgive me of my sins. Of course there is more, but I think the best way to pray is to say how you truly feel. There is no need to be ashamed. Try it for yourself and see.",society_culture
"Please honestly share - What was the craziest thing you ever did during your entire life? Okay - it's only fair that I share my experience first.  As a child vacationing in downtown Pittsburg PA with my family, we were in the audience of a television game show.  We were asked to write down ""the craziest thing we could think of doing"" and submit it at one point early in the program.  I remembered seeing a large landscaped water fountain in a courtyard outside the studio.  My answer was to ""go skinny-dipping in that fountain.""  Was I ever shocked and so totally embarrassed when they called out my name later in the program?  Oh, yes!  Someone had to literally take me by the arm and drag me up on the stage and into the camera's view, but it was worth the silver dollar I won.  BTW - I never did go skinny-dipping in that fountain.

"Does susquatch really exist ? This is a fasinating subject for , I may go in search of - over the summer ! Bigfoot, (also known as Sasquatch), is the name of a phenomenon which has polarised people around the world, being either the product of vivid imagination or a creature that has somehow avoided close observation or capture by man.\n\nBigfoot is described as a large, bipedal hairy humanoid creature living in remote wilderness areas of the United States and Canada, specifically those in southwestern Canada, the Great Lakes, the Pacific Northwest, the Rocky Mountains, the forests of the U.S. Northeast, and the U.S. Southern states. Some claim it is a creature which may be found around the world under different regional names, such as the Yeti, or is at least a closely related species. Sightings have allegedly occurred in Malaysia, China, Russia, Australia, South America and Hawaii. [1] [2] [3]\n\nThe majority of scientists reject the possibility of the creature's existence, and consider the stories of Bigfoot to be a combination of unsubstantiated folklore and hoax. This is due to current scientific knowledge plus the lack of bones or a body.\n\n\nI believe it, the earth is still undiscovered. So there are things that go bump in the night.",society_culture

"Christians, what do you think about this dream I had last night? A man was driving west through Arizona on an interstate highway when he looked at his dashboard and saw he was almost out of gas.  There were no roadside stations in sight but he needed gas very soon.  The next exit was for a small town about 3 miles off the interstate so he took the exit to find gas.  It was a cold, wet, windy, winter day and as he traveled down the road to the little town he noticed a young man walking on the side of the road toward the interstate.  With little concern he traveled on to the town and filled up his tank.  \n\nAs he turned and drove back to the interstate he came upon the young  man again.  He was wearing a light jacket holding his arms close to his chest leaning forward into the freezing wind and rain obviously miserable and cold.  As the car approached the young man on the road he just barely put out his left thumb so as to indicate he needed a lift but trying to maintain some body heat.\n\nAs the driver passed by the young  man something inside him told him to stop.  He had never before stopped to pick up anyone like this before.  He brought his car to a stop about a quarter mile down the road from the young man.  As he turned to look back through the rear windshield he could see the young man running down the road toward his car.  Soon the young man was standing at the passenger door looking in the through the window the driver had lowered.  \n\n“I sure could use a lift,” said the young man.  The driver asked,  “which way do you need to go?”  The young man replied, “I need to go east.  Are you going that way?”  The driver hesitated for just a moment and then said, “Yeah.  I’m going east.  Get in.”\n\nThe young man almost jumped into the car.  His hair was covered in ice and with the warmth of the car it began to melt and drip from his hair.  As the driver pulled onto the road heading back to the highway he asked the young man, “where do you need to go?”  He replied, “I’m trying to get to my dad’s house in Virginia”.  The driver said, “That’s a long way to hitch hike don’t you think?  Why didn’t you call you dad and get some help getting back home?”\n\nThe young man replied, “ I haven’t talked to my dad in 5 years.  I left home on bad terms with him.  I was doing some things I new I shouldn’t do and dad didn’t approve.  So I left and said I’m never coming back.  Now I’ve lost my job.  I’ve lost my girl friend.  I have no money, no friends, and no place to live.  I don’t have anything left and nowhere to go.  I was afraid to call him. What if he said no I can’t come home?  Then what would I do?  Where would I go?  I thought if I can just make it back home maybe I can walk up and knock on his door.  Tell him how sorry I am.  Maybe he would let me come home.”\n\nThe driver pulled his car onto the interstate and headed east retracing the path from which he had just come.  The two continued to talk about what had happened in the young man’s life.  \n\nAs they drove and talked they soon came to a large city.  The driver without saying why began following the signs that showed the way to the airport.  The young man asked, “Where are we going.”  The driver responded, “I’m going to pay for a ticket for you to fly home.  You need to be with your dad.”  The two went into the airport together where the driver bought the ticket.  He handed it to the young man and said, “you’d better hurry you’re going to miss your flight.”  The young man hugged the driver and then with tears in his eyes he said, “You know, you didn’t have to do this, did you?”  \n\nThe driver paused for just a moment and looking back into the young man’s eyes responded, “ Yeah, I think I did.”\n\nI then found myself looking up a the crucified Jesus hanging on the cross looking down into my eyes.  I looked up at him acknowledging what He had done for me and with tears in my eyes I said, “You know, You didn’t have to do this, did You?”   \n\nJ Very nice dream.  Thanks for posting it.  The representation in the dream is very good.  We the human family through rebellion and disobedience left our Heavenly Father, just like the boy in this dream left his father.  We then often find ourselves in dire situations, and want our Heavenly Father to forgive us and help us just like this boy did.  Jesus then, just like the kind man in this dream, paid the price and ticket to made possible for us to be forgiven and get back to our Father. \n\n Father forgive us and teach us that truth that sets us free (John 8:32).",society_culture

Much earlier in stage history, when superstition had a less frightening hold on the craft, actors and their followers used a more gracious greeting: ""May you break your leg,"" by which it was meant that the evening's performance would be of such grandeur that the actor would be obliged to break his leg - that is bend his knee - in a deep bow acknowledging the audience's applause.",society_culture

Also known as a tongue Kiss, or Deep Kiss.\n\nWhile family members may sometimes kiss on the lips, a tongue kiss almost always indicates a romantic or sexual relationship. French kissing stimulates the lips, tongue and mouth, which are all areas very sensitive to touch. It is considered by many to be both very pleasurable and highly intimate. Unlike other forms of ""casual"" kissing (such as brief kisses of greeting or friendship), episodes of French kissing will often be prolonged, intense, and passionate. It may signal the beginning of a period of ""making out"" or sex. Because of the intimacy associated with it, in many regions of the world tongue kissing in public is not acceptable to most, particularly in the case of extended duration. See: public display of affection.\n\nIn a tongue kiss participants may exchange saliva, which would often be considered disgusting in other contexts, but which may add to the passion and excitement of the sexual kiss. Although most sexually-transmitted diseases are not transmitted by kissing, the exchange of saliva in a French kiss may increase the chances of catching an orally transmitted disease. Infectious Mononucleosis (American: Mononucleosis or, colloquially, ""mono""; European: Glandular Fever), a disease spread through saliva, is often colloquially referred to as ""the kissing disease.""",society_culture

"Can the HOLY TRINITY be revealed in How we are Created in God's Image? God is spirit. He cannot be seen. If you were to examine all the creatures, the CREATOR has made a pattern emerges: angels and demons are intellectual creatures without a body; plants and animals do not have an intellect but a body and mortal soul. IT IS ONLY LIVING, HUMAN, BEINGS, that have a MIND, BODY, and SOUL. Only human beings have all three. Now, living, human, being is the existence of man. Those words describe the essence of man's mind, body, and soul. The Body is living, the Mind makes us human and distinguishing us from animals, and our Soul makes us the being that we become (good or evil).\n\nNow, even Muslims will agree Allah is omnipotent (all powerful), omniscient (all knowing), and omnipresent (ever present). These words describe the existence of God. So, what is the essence of God? I will hold off answering this question till the end.

Mother and daughter took the window seat in the second to last row; River’s dad took the aisle seat. As the plane was getting ready to move, Gillette tucked in next to the window and began to discreetly nurse River.That’s when Gillette noticed the lone flight attendant holding out a blanket, telling Gillette that she needed to cover up.,” she says. “I was being as discreet as possible.” When Gillette refused, Gillette says the flight attendant responded; “You are offending me. You need to cover up.” Gillette refused again.   Gillette says the flight attendant huffed off, and returned with a ticket agent, who told the family that they were being thrown off the plane.

Because he is perfect, he never sinned, nor was he ever tempted. And yet by sending his Son to earth, who was man and God, he gained the experience of being tempted to sin. Remember when Satan tempted Christ three times after Christ's 40 days of fasting in the desert. This was the first time that God was ever tempted to sin.\n\nThis is how God's mercy--or what you call compassion--was born. This is how he came to know what it was like to be human.

"How do blind people imagine things? By blind I am only referring to people who are blind from birth.\n\nHow do they imagine things? What do they dream? They sure have no idea about colours and other things. I always wonder how they visualize things? Hi Maddy, I am taking a few moments this morning to reduce stress, pre-wedding jitters, not really nerves, just the usual worries of everything going correctly, as planned. lol \n\nSo, here I am anwering one of your great questions! ;-)  I too have often mused on how the blind or others who have lost a sense, manage to do things, normal everyday things those who have all five senses take for granted on a daily basis. I have mused on what it would be like to be blind. You see, one of my daughters had a knife put out her left eye when she was six. It was a horrific experiance for her and also her father and I. While she has not been completely blind sense birth, we have always been very worried, and sensitive of the worry she may lose sight in her one remaining eye. She was able to 'keep' her damaged eye, but she is basically 90% blind, only able to see shadows and blurred color in it. So, you can imagine this is something I have thought about a great deal. \n\nI read the answers you received when I first clicked here. Bonacua B is as close to an honest interpretation, or considered response than any other. Now, imagination does not require sight. They 'way' they imagine things will be different than those with sight, but they still will have dreams and imagination. Blind folks are as capable of those with sight of being able to be imaginative, innovative, creative and otherwise intuitive. They are in a unique position to provide an alternate view, which can be very impressive. When we are in a 'think tank' it is of best interest to implement as diverse a group as possible. When we keep the group diverse we are able to obtain a uniquely cohesive thought process which can produce great innovative and creative 'out of the box' thinking. This will enable the group to come up with a tremendously increased measure of ideas and concepts. When we place a group of non diverse members into a position of requiring innovative and creative ideas, they are limited to only simular processes as they all have the same abilities and therefor are limited. \n\nThe blind may not be able to see 'color' but color has more than a visual affect. Color is uniquely viewed by each individual with sight. Men and women see colors differently. There are scientific studies which demonstrate these differences between the sexes when it comes to seeing color. The blind are able to imagine colors by using verbal stimuli to create a visual concept. Colors also create emotions, blue is calming, red is stimulating, yellow is comforting, black can be either rage, or blankness, grey is dismal, etc. By utilizing all the elements of color the blind are able to concepulize these and form their own unique 'vision' of color. \n\nEmotions are very strong elements, and they are created from many differing sourses. When we are able to utilize all of our resourses we are then able to acheive our highest potentials. The blind are not any different in this as those who see. \n\nThose who are born blind do NOT increase other senses to 'compensate' for the lost sense. Studies have shown that the other senses which are seeminly increased, are available for the sighted to acheive those inhanced heighths. We ALL have the capasity to use our senses to a maximine capasite, the same as the blind, we just don't do it. When we are trained to use our senses to the highest levels we are able to acheive seeminly spiritual elements within our abilities to minipulate them. Most people just do not work on increasing their senses to the degree of their full capasity. The blind are trained to do so. So, it is not an ability to obtain any higher degree of use in remaining senses, above the ability of any seeing person, it is just they work at acheiving these 'high' degree of developed senses. \n\nI firmly believe the born blind are as able as any other to imagine and dream. The way this is manifested may be different, of course it",society_culture
"What do you do if you've been fired from a job & your ex-co-worker still calls you and asks you for help? I was fired in April of 2006, and part of the reason I was fired was because I kept covering for a co-worker (the team secretary) and I was unable to get some of my projects completed in enough time to please my boss...  So now, she's calling me and asking me for help on projects!  Specifically, stuff that the IT people should be able to answer, and she asks, saying ""I know you don't work here anymore, but -on the basis of our friendship- I was hoping you could help me.""

I really want to put this job behind me. If you do care for her feelings, but want to put the job behind you, you need to tell her honestly and bluntly, that because you are not working there, your time and resources need to be devoted to other things, such as getting a new job, (if you need one and haven't been hired by someone else already,) however, you might want to suggest she seek the aid of the IT people you mentioned. The way you handle this varies on your friendship with her. It will not be easy, particularly if you covered for her in the past.

"How prevalent is female circumcision in the world today?  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female_circumcision  this site has much information on this topic\n\nFemale genital cutting\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n(Redirected from Female circumcision)\nJump to: navigation, search\nFemale genital cutting (FGC) refers to amputation of any part of the female genitalia for cultural, rather than medical, reasons.\n\nMost Human rights organizations in the West, Africa, and Asia consider female genital cutting rituals a violation of women's human rights. Among these groups and governments, they are regarded as unacceptable and illegal forms of body modification and mutilation of those believed to be too young or otherwise unable to give informed consent.\n\nAlthough occasionally practiced by some doctors in the United States until 1958, in recent years it is only common in parts of Africa and by minority groups in some countries of the Middle East. Less frequently, it occurs among some immigrant communities in parts of Asia and the Pacific, North and Latin America, and Europe.\n\nOpponents of these practices use the term female genital mutilation (FGM). The official term female circumcision is also in common usage, though advocates of male circumcision argue that this results in unwanted associations between the two practices, while genital integrity advocates might refer to all child genital cutting as mutilation. It also should be noted that the term encompases a wide variety of practices some of which are frequently equated directly with male circumscion, others which involve a far great level of cutting or mutilation and others yet which involve no real cutting or mutilation.",society_culture

"Why is it that the different branches of christianity dislike each other so much? Pardon my ignorance. i only know basics of christianity. One of the wisest stories my father ever told me was about the old wiseman who used to sit out by the lake thinking all day. Every day he'd go out there and almost every day he would think of something profound to say. People eventually began to gather to hear his thoughts. Soon people started writing down those same thoughts.  \n\nOne day a mouse disturbed the wise man's meditations. So from then on a cat was brought out every day to prevent mice from disturbing him again. \n\nEventually the wise man died. The people who came to listen to him continued to gather under the tree by the lake to remember him and to read again the wisdom he had given them.  It did not seem right without a cat. So a cat was brought out each gathering. Soon people began to argue over whether it should be a white cat or a black cat or a striped cat. Then there were three gatherings... \n\nThat is basically what happened with Christianity. The fights became blood fueds however. In England for example Catholics and other Christian minorities at one time could not own property, be a noble and faced many other restrictuions on their lives. Most European nations became one one religion or another. Wars that were really national aggression were fought in the name of religion. Those who tried to remain another religion in these nations were often executed. Being Protestant or Jewish during the Spanish Inquisition for example could be fatal. \n\nSo today people hate without even knowing why. False rumors like the one about Catholics worshiping idols float around. Discrimanation still exists on a very subtle level with various forms of Christianity. Then there are the quasi Christian religions such as the Mormans who faced severe persecution early in their formation. \n\nIt is nothing new. The Catholic church became unified by Rome's sword. Any sect not approved of by Rome generally did not survive long. After that the Chruch held great sway until Protestents fought wars to secure freedom for their particuler brand of Christianity. \n\nWith so many non-denominational chruches springing up I think you'll see a major softening in the lines between branches of Christianity over the next decade. Most Christians are tired of it and there are enough non-Christians around in the West today that Christians are starting to feel a Christian is a Christian instead of the fierce rivalries that dominated the last few hundred years.",society_culture

If someone sneezes more than once they say these words (two of them for two sneezes, three of them for three sneezes) : salud, dinero, y amor (""health, money, and love"").

"Is God around when a married couple is having sex? A certain Chinese author interprets that the Chinese character on God 'shen' shows that he is standing by the side of two entwine persons in sex position. Christians believe that God is omnipresent. This sort of encourages me to think about the intimacy of God and human being to the extent that even he is present when a couple is having sex. So far counsellors on marriage may not have put such fact so crudely as much as I have done here. But I need to gather this answer for a book which suggests that is how the Chinese character on God is formed or created. Chinese character very often is constructed as a picture in abstract form. If Christians believe that presence is possible then my book in highlighting that will then be acceptable. I would like to express my great appreciation for your answers. Many different people have different beliefs. I believe that God is around no matter what your doing. He is even around when you think.

"Is the public school system going downhill? My son is a second grader.  I have had so many problems with different things at his school and it just seems like when you complain it does no good.  The teachers, principal and even the superintendent acts like you are a bother or they just dont care.  Everything is disregarded.  They act like everything kids do now is normal, so its ok.  Seems to me that things are so different at school now from when I was a kid.  The teachers and principals wouldnt tolerate anything from the kids or let things happen that shouldnt.  What do you think of the public school system? If you drop a frog in boiling water, it will jump right out, but if you put the same frog in cool water and turn up the heat slowly, it will allow itself to boil to death.  The frogs are boiling in public schools.  Too many parents believe that the moment their child steps through the doors of the public school, their responsibilities as a parent stops. R-rated movies are shown to 15 year olds *with* parental permission, b/c the parent is afraid to ""rock the boat"" for fear that the child will face retribution or not be allowed to play on the basketball team b/c the teacher is also the coach.  2nd graders who make death threats against other children are not taken seriously, b/c ""boys will be boys"".  Parents who do raise questions about curriculum or discipline are labeled as troublemakers and are frequently asked to withdraw their children to either private or home schooling b/c the administrators/teachers would rather not make an effort to actually deal with the problems.

She very much has the right, I know the case you speak of, I believe his name is Patrick Stewart, i don't remember his rank.  I think that its horrid that the military has not taken the steps to allow the pentagram to be an accepted religious symbol.  Afterall, it was taken of the hate symbol list a long time ago.  \n\nThis is a story you might enjoy about the military who is trying to put up appearances to get Wiccan solidiers to join,but then dropping the ball of equality.  \n\nI was recently on a military base visitin a friend of mine, she's Gypsy Pagan and I'm Wiccan.  The military ONLY recognizes Wicca and no other pagan religions, so if she wants to go to circle on base, she has to do it with the Wiccan group, but on Andrews AFB, there is no Wiccan group, because they require you have specific accredidations to be the Chaplain representative for that base, you can't just go get a ULC http://www.ulc.org/?destination=ordination ordination, you have to go to college.  (Very hard to find college classes for Wicca)  But there is a circle of nearby Fort Meade, they meet in the chapel like every other relgiion and their meetings are even mosted on the sign outside with all the other meetings with a day of the week and time.  \n\nSo we go to Fort Meade on April 30th for the Beltane ritual and meet in the parking lot, we arrived a little early and were suprised to see what seemed like a SOuthern Baptist group heading into our part of the chapel.  As our chaplain representative arrived, she became bold enought to enter and ask them to move out because, as the sign outside stated, we are alotted this time and had reserved it as an ongoing reservation.  The person she talked to, I believe one of the deacons, asked her what group she was from and then, when she answered, started laughing, he said they had reserved the time slot with the chaplain last week and that they weren't moving.  We called the chaplain, but he never picked up his cell phone, we left several messages, but then just continued our ritual outside while children from the Baptist group continued to gawk at us and make comments.",society_culture

"According to which Hindu mythology, the worship of 'Shiva linga' has been started? Don't need any funny or obscene answers. According to legend, when Bhrigu Maharishi performed a yagna, he was worried as to which amongst the three Lords-- Bramha, Vishnu or Shankar, was truly worthy of the fruits of the yagna. So he himself went out to determine the three Gods' true worth. Bhrigu was a very powerful saint and is said to have been short tempered. Also he had a third eye on the base of his right foot of which he was very proud.\n\nFirst Bhrigu went to Bramhalok and saw that Bramha was engrossed in the generation-activities of the three worlds along with his consort Saraswati and did not pay any attention towards the arrival of the saint, so he cursed him that Bramha wont be worshipped anywhere. As a result we practically dont have any shrines dedicated to Bramha in the entire country barring one in Pushkar in Rajasthan in India.\n\nSecond he went to Kailasha t find Shankara and his consort Parvati engrossed in the eternal cosmic dance 'Ananda Tandava'. they too didnt pay any attention to Bhrigu's arrival and the saint being angered cursed Shankara that he wont be worshipped in his physical form on Bhooloka (earth), and when Shankara realized his mistake, Bhrigu granted that only the incorporeal form of Shankara ( the linga form) be worshipped. Hence we see the worship of Shiva Linga.\n\nThird  he went to vaikuntha the abode od Vishnu and Lakshmi, where Vishnu was in yoganidra and hence did not see the saint's arrival. enraged by not being welcomed by any of the three major gods, the saint in a rage of fury kicked on the chest of Vishnu. Vishnu awakened by the force of the kick quickly realized his mistake and took the saints leg in his hands and pressed the third eye in it, thereby crushing the ego of the saint. \n\nthe story goes on that Lakshmi (who stayed in the heart of Vishnu) angered at the saint for kicking the chest of Vishnu and by Vishnu pressing the leg of Bhrigu, left Vaikuntha and Vishnu to be born on earth as Padmini where she was eventually wooed by Vishnu in the form of Venkateshwara.\n\nthats my knowledge of how shivalinga came to be worshipped.\nthough there must be other legends too for this.\n\nhope it helps.\n\nthanks",society_culture

"Do you believe in god and why??? Do you??? God. This explanation is what everyone eventually resorts to when the other answers fail. Throughout all of human history, we've been trying to explain existence. But nobody has ever succeeded. And it's likely that nobody ever will. So we create the concept of God, whose only necessary property is being ""that which explains existence."" \n\nThis doesn't tell us much about god, though. It doesn't mean that any particular religion is correct. It merely defines god as something which answers The Question, because we have not been able to. \nbut...\nThe Bible represents a fundamental guidepost for millions of people on the planet, in much the same way the Koran, Torah, and Pali Canon offer guidance to people of other religions. If you and I could dig up documentation that contradicted the holy stories of Islamic belief, Judaic belief, Buddhist belief, pagan belief, should we do that? Should we wave a flag and tell the Buddhists that we have proof the Buddha did not come from a lotus blossom? Or that Jesus was not born of a literal virgin birth? Those who truly understand their faiths understand the stories are metaphorical.""Sophie looked skeptical. ""My friends who are devout Christians definitely believe that Christ literally walked on water, literally turned water into wine, and was born of a literal virgin birth.""""My point exactly,"" Langdon said.

"Where was Noah's Ark supposedly found? I read a while back that someone thought they had found it, but I never could find details. Searching for the Ark\n\nSince the 19th century, there have been numerous attempts to find the ark on the mountains of Ararat. These mountains have two prominent peaks, one 16,950 feet high and the other 12,840 feet. The higher of the two is perpetually covered by snow. Because of the climatic changes that followed the Flood, the ark would soon have been buried by snow. Some investigators firmly believe that the ark is still there, buried deep in a glacier. They claim that there have been periods when the ice melted sufficiently to permit part of the ark to be exposed temporarily.\n\nThe book In Search of Noah’s Ark quotes George Hagopian, an Armenian, who claimed that he climbed Mount Ararat and saw the ark in 1902 and again in 1904. On the first visit, he said, he actually climbed on top of the ark. “I stood up straight and looked all over the ship. It was long. The height was about forty feet [12 m].” Regarding his observation on his subsequent visit, he said: “I didn’t see any real curves. It was unlike any other boat I have ever seen. It looked more like a flat-bottomed barge.”\n\nFrom 1952 to 1969, Fernand Navarra made four efforts to find evidence of the ark. On his third trip to Mount Ararat, he worked his way to the bottom of a crevasse in a glacier, where he found a piece of black wood embedded in the ice. “It must have been very long,” he said, “and perhaps still attached to other parts of the ship’s framework.

He drowns us, he kills our babies, and now we can't live as long? Just last week God  pulled me over just for diving while human!  What's next? Whats scary is I'm an agnostic and I know the answer to this.\n\nThe Bible, which as you know is not the word of God but a story, explains about the flood of Noah. The first 10 generations had these long life spans, Noah lived to be 600 he was the 10th. After the flood the creation scientists believe that life spans started getting shorter. This is also their explanation why the Earth can be 6000 years old and has fossills that appear to be millions of years old, because during the flood there was rapid decay.  They also believe no creature died before the sin of Adam.  It is because we learn the creation science and compare it to our own understanding of chemistry, anthropology, astronomy, physics, biology, and history, that we reject this creation science view, but put it in its proper context, that it is a mythology.\n\nSo to answer the question, your life span is shorter according to the judeo christian mythology because of the flood during the days of Noah.",society_culture

"who is hochiminh?  He was originally named Nguyễn Sinh Cung, is also known as Nguyễn Tất Thành, Nguyễn Ái Quốc (a name which means ""Nguyễn the patriot""), Lý Thụy, Hồ Quang (among others) and is popularly called Bác Hồ (Uncle Hồ) in Vietnam.\n\nBiography\nHồ Chí Minh was born in Hoang Tru Village (maternal homeland) and lived there in the earliest period of his life (1890 - 1895) and grew up in Kim Lien Village (paternal homeland), Nam Dan District, Nghe An Province, Vietnam. Following Confucian traditions, he received the name Nguyễn Tất Thành at age 10. He had two siblings, his brother Nguyen Tat Dat (or Nguyễn Sinh Khiem), a geomancer and traditional herbalist and his sister Bach Lien (or Nguyen Thi Thanh) who worked as a clerk in the French Army.\n\nHis father, Nguyễn Sinh Sắc was a Confucian scholar, and He himself received a strong Confucian upbringing. He also received a modern secondary education at a French-style lycee in Huế, the alma mater of his later disciples, Phạm Văn Ðồng and Võ Nguyên Giáp. Hồ Chí Minh applied for a course at the French ""Colonial Administrative School"" immediately after he arrived in Marseille. However, his application was rejected. (This document is still preserved at the National Archives of France. Historian Nguyen The Anh has photocopied and published it in his book.)\n\nIn 1911, Hồ Chí Minh went to the South to Gia Dinh (Saigon) and joined a ship en route to Marseille, France as a cabin-boy. Hồ Chí Minh’s first time abroad was not easy, he worked hard, such as being a cleaner, waiter, cook helper, film developer. On the other hand, he was very excited with what he learned from a totally different world each day. He often went to the public library, read newspapers and paid close attention to the current affairs and political issues.\n\nHe lived in England in the period 1913 - 1917 where he trained as a pastry chef under the legendary French master, Escoffier at the Carlton Hotel in the Haymarket, Westminster. There is a commemorative [Blue Plaque] on the building, which is now New Zealand House.\n\nHồ Chí Minh embraced Communism while living abroad in France from 1917 - 1923. Following World War I, as Nguyễn Ái Quốc, in behalf of the ""Group of Vietnamese Patriots"" he petitioned the great powers at the Versailles peace talks for equal rights in French Indochina but was ignored. He asked sitting U.S. President Woodrow Wilson for help to overthrow the French in Vietnam and to have a free democratic government, but was denied. He soon helped form the French Communist Party and spent much time in Moscow. He later moved to Guangzhou, China, where he founded the Vietnamese Communist Party.\n\n \nHồ Chí Minh lying in state in his mausoleum that is viewed by thousands of supporters and tourists.He returned to Vietnam in 1941 to lead the Việt Minh independence movement, conducting successful military actions against the Japanese occupation forces and later against the French bid to reoccupy the country (1946-1954). He adopted the name Hồ Chí Minh (胡 志明), a Sino-Vietnamese name with a common surname (Hồ ) and a given name meaning aspiring (Chí) to light (Minh) in August 1942 while going to China and he was jailed by Chiang Kai-shek's local authorities. After about 1 year, he was released and returned to Vietnam. After August Revolution (1945) organized by Việt Minh, he became Chairman of Provisional Government (Premier) of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam), when he forced Emperor Bảo Đại to abdicate but this was not recognised internationally.\n\nHe signed an agreement with France which recognized Vietnam as an autonomous state in the Indochinese Federation and the French Union on March 6, 1946 but that compromise did not prevent war. That December the French tried to re-establish their colonial rule in the country following the Chinese withdrawal from the North in exchange for French-occupied",society_culture

A ""diabetic"" is someone who has a disease called ""diabetes,"" which means their body can't produce enough insulin to properly handle sugars in their bloodstream.  Many such people have to take insulin shots daily to manage their disease.\n\nThe sentence indicates that the person had the disease diabetes for a long time (years) before knowing they had it  (""undiagnosed"" means that no doctor has found the disease in them), and with such a serious disease not being known about or treated for a long time, it got ""a real good start"" meaning it caused serious problems.\n\nHope that's clearer :)",society_culture

For example,Adam and Moses living for hundreds of years.\nIf you think the bible is metaphorical,then surely you are admitting that it is just a bunch of stories,yet you still believe it.Why? I'm agnostic, but here's the deal: of course the Bible is metaphor. Garden of Eden, Noah's Ark, parting of Red Sea, Sodom & Gomorrah, Virgin Birth, Lazarus rasied from the Dead, etc. But we have to remember that those stories were all told by a group of semi-nomadic, largely illiterate people living 2000 years ago. They were simply using metaphor and allegor and symbolism to convey as best they could their understanding of God. So yes, they ARE a bunch of stories, if you want to over-simplify like that, but the big question is: what compelled them to go to such lengths to create such myths? And why would Jesus' disciples risk death--and incur death--if they thought he was a fake? After his death they could have simply disbanded, yet they continued on. To me--the reasons for the stories are more important than the literal accuracy. To read the Bible like a history book is to totallt miss the point!",society_culture

Is it related to divination like astrology, palmistry, numerology ? A nut with little or no formal training \n\nParapsychology is the study of certain types of paranormal phenomena (parapsychology comes from the Greek para, “beside, beyond,” + psychology, derived from the Greek psyche, “soul, mind,” + logos “rational discussion”). The term was coined by Max Dessoir (1889). J. B. Rhine adopted it to refer to the scientific study of paranormal phenomena which are manifestations of psi.A ccording to The Parapsychological Association, an organization affiliated with the American Association for the Advancement of Science[4], parapsychological phenomena can be categorized thus:\n\nThese [paranormal] anomalies fall into three general categories: ESP[...] [Extra-Sensory Perception], PK [Psychokinesis], and phenomena suggestive of survival after bodily death, including near-death experiences, apparitions, and reincarnation. Most parapsychologists today expect that further research will eventually explain these anomalies in scientific terms, although it is not clear whether they can be fully understood without significant (some might say revolutionary) expansions of the current state of scientific knowledge. Other researchers take the stance that existing scientific models of perception and memory are adequate to explain some or all parapsychological phenomena.",society_culture

"what happens? What happens when you are disassociated from the Jehovah Witness'? ""Disassociation"" is a term used with particular meaning within the Christian Congregation of Jehovah's Witnesses.\n\nOnly a baptized Witness can ""disassociate"" HIMSELF (or herself) from the Jehovah's Witness religion. That is sometimes done formally in writing or in a serious conversation with an elder committee, but a Witness who joins the military or publicly engages in worship with another religion is also considered to have disassociated himself from Jehovah's Witnesses.\n\nThose who have ""disassociated"" themselves are considered the same as those who have been ""disfellowshipped"".\n\nJehovah's Witnesses practice the Scriptural practice of disfellowshipping for unrepentance of such serious sins as fornication, drug abuse, stealing, and apostasy. \n\nContrary to the misinformation of anti-Witnesses, it is quite possible to become inactive in the JW religion without becoming disfellowshipped. As long as one's lifestyle does not bring reproach upon the congregation, and as long as one does not advocate one's disagreements with the religion, the congregation has no interest in ""investigating"", exposing, and disfellowshipping an inactive former Jehovah's Witness.\n\nFor those who are disfellowshipped or disassociated, a primary goal is to shock the person into recognizing the seriousness of their actions so that they will be moved to rejoin the congregation in pure worship. Since the primary bonds that are broken involve friendship and spiritual fellowship, it is well understood that family bonds remain intact. Parents, siblings, and grown children of disfellowshipped and disassociated ones sometimes choose to limit what they may feel is discouraging or ""bad association"" but that is a personal decision and is not required by their religion.\n\nFormer Witnesses who are disfellowshipped or disassociated are typically treated in accord with the Scriptural pattern explained in these Scriptures:\n\n(1 Corinthians 5:11-13) Quit mixing in company with anyone called a brother that is a fornicator or a greedy person or an idolater or a reviler or a drunkard or an extortioner, not even eating with such a man. ...Remove the wicked man from among yourselves.\n\n(Titus 3:10) As for a man that promotes a sect, reject him after a first and a second admonition\n\n(Romans 16:17) Now I exhort you, brothers, to keep your eye on those who cause divisions and occasions for stumbling contrary to the teaching that you have learned, and avoid them.\n\n(2 Thessalonians 3:6) Now we are giving you orders, brothers, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, to withdraw from every brother walking disorderly and not according to the tradition you received from us.\n\n(2 Thessalonians 3:14) But if anyone is not obedient to our word through this letter, keep this one marked, stop associating with him, that he may become ashamed.\n\n(2 John 10) If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching, never receive him into your homes or say a greeting to him.\n\n(Matthew 18:17) If he does not listen to them, speak to the congregation. If he does not listen even to the congregation, let him be to you just as a man of the nations\n\n\nBecoming baptized as a Jehovah's Witnesses is not a trivial step. At a minimum, a student must demonstrate months of regular meeting attendance and public ministry, then must himself express the desire to be baptized. The candidate then spends hours answering hundreds of bible questions wherein he expresses both a clear understanding and personal conviction regarding Jehovah's Witness teachings in at least three separate interviews with three different elders. The candidate must vocally agree to be baptized in front of hundreds or thousands of eyewitnesses, and must be publicly immersed in water. This is not a momentary emotional decision by an unreasoning child. Dedication as a Witness required hard work and determination at the time.\n\nLea",society_culture

Alan Davidson, editor of the Oxford Companion to Food states that no printed recipe for the present-day croissant appears in any French recipe book before the early 20th century; the earliest French reference to a croissant he found was among the ""fantasy or luxury breads"" in Payen's Des substances alimentaires, 1853.\n\nThe ""Siege of Vienna"" story seems to owe its wide diffusion to Alfred Gottschalk, who wrote about the croissant for the first edition of the Larousse Gastronomique (1938). Gottschalk first cited the legend about the Turkish attack on Budapest in 1686, in the ""history of food"" section in the same work, he opted for the ""siege of Vienna in 1683"" version; compare the cappuccino legend.",society_culture

"Is blatant hypocrisy a prerequisite for leading a Christian church?  But of course.\n\nWho leads a Xtian church?  Why the priests of course.\n\nWho sets the moral standards that are to be followed by Xtians?  The priests frothing at their mouths reading excerpts from the Bible.\n\nSo, how can a priest, who is supposed to in communion with God and his perfectness, lead a flock of parishioners without having known his sins and the evil they supposedly entail?\n\nPriests are the root of how we view the dichotomy of bad & good, and have had cultural impact as such since the times of Biblical record.  They have helped, over time, to develop our value system of good / evil in every religion.\n\nTherefore, they must have been in concert with immoral values at one time to know that they were evil.  It is the priests and the noble class that have lead us to our cultural viewpoint we have today, which is that of a slave of religious ethics.\n\nSo....that makes the Xtain church leaders exceedingly hypocritical for they are the ones responsible for defining sin.   They have told us how to live ethically in accordance with the Bible.  Therefore they are the ones who have set the value of sin in the first place.  We are slaves to their good values, and are appalled by their evil valuations.  THERE WOULD BE NO EVIL IF IT WAS NOT FOR THE PRIESTS SAYING IT IS EVIL.\n\nThat is how the Xtian leaders are hypocritical.",society_culture

Most of the people that ask these questions seem to be just looking for a fight, or are they actually begging for someone to show them the way to God?

So if they are already set in their ways, why do they ask the yahoo answer community, people they don't even know, about it?  Either way Religion sure does get a lot of answers... Your observation is correct.  Religion is such a hot issue or topic that strikes a raw nerve in many.  Perhaps, it is because people fear of what they don't know.\n\nIt depends on your perspective and also on the perspective of those who post and answer questions on this thread of Religion and Spirituality.  \n\nThis may both test us and them.  As for me, I learn from the questions and answers that others post.  There are many who really don't understand the Bible and a lot more who don't even visit any church.

Does that ban creativity?  Not really, since the club owners aren't telling the artist that he/she can never play it or record it anywhere.

"What was the actual SIN of Sodom & Gamorrah? Most theist, especially those claiming to be ""christian,"" claim that is was homosexuality when in fact ""homosexuality"" is not even mentioned anywhere in the Genesis 13 account  As a matter of fact, you can read the sin of Sodom in Ezekiel:\n\n "" `Now this was the sin of your sister Sodom: She and her daughters were ARROGANT, OVEFED and UNCONCERNED; they DID NOT HELP the POOR and NEEDY.  EZE 16:49\n\nIt appears that the people became self indulgent and did not care for the needs of others.  Sounds a lot like most of us in this modern era.  Thank God that Jesus was sent for our redemption. I think first off you have a wrong idea of what sin is, and so your question becomes difficult to answer.  \n\nSin is often thought of by modern day people as an act that one does that God does not approve of.  This is a fine definition in some respects, however when one begins to speak of God, this definition is hardly adequate, because it leaves open the possibility of one being able not to sin, which scripture clearly teaches against.  Sin could better be defined, (as it was in the ancient church) as separation from God, or even as a loss of the ""image of God"" which was bestowed upon Adam and Eve at their creation.  When one thinks of sin in those terms there is not a specific sin that caused God to destroy Sodom and Gomorrah, instead there is a lack of faith, or realtionship with God.  This faith, or Relationship comes from the promise of God given to Adam and Eve in Genesis 3:15-16, that One will come from Eve's womb whom Satan will pierce but who will crush Satan's head.  Only when God works through that means can one have faith, which none had in Sodom and Gomorrah.  Further more, when one looks at the book of Matthew (25:40ff) one understands what Ezekiel was saying.  With out faith, one cannot do good works to serve their neighbor.  However at the time when God puts Himself into relationship with man, everything that they do is a good work, and consequently, in their faith relationship they are not arrogant, overfed, unconcerned, and they help the poor and needy.  \n\nIn the end you are right with your last statement in the question: ""It appears that the people became self indulgent and did not care for the needs of others. Sounds a lot like most of us in this modern era. Thank God that Jesus was sent for our redemption.""",society_culture

I just wanted to see if the fact that it is an Indian wedding changes people's feelings about the appropriateness of wearing white.  Thanks! The etiquette for not wearing white to a traditional American wedding is based on the fact that the bride is anticipated to be wearing white, and the color has been reserved for her to make her stand out on her special day. If cultural differences don't dictate that the bride wears a certain color, then don't worry about it. Just wear something that still puts the focus on the bride on her special day.

For example, who would claim that merely by chance, your house key was cut exactly to fit the door? Or that it ended up in your pocket by chance, in the first place? No one would claim that the billboards along the road were put there by chance, or that the meanings they intend came about by randomly painted symbols.\nBy the same token, no one would deny that a staple—nothing other than a specially shaped piece of wire on your desk—was bent and placed in its dispenser in order to hold papers together. Each staple's metal alloy, size, shape, and intended function show the evidence of deliberate design. It was planned specifically to accommodate your needs; and there's a particular reason why staples are so often found in any office setting.\nWhat about the people you see walking along the street? Or the trees you pass by, the dog that runs out in front of you, the pigeons that build their nests in the eaves of your house, the flowers on your table, the sky above you? Could their existence be by chance, do you think?\nIt would be nonsense to even consider this possibility! Everything surrounding you, animate and inanimate alike, is too wonderful and complex to be compared with man-made items or ever to be ascribed to the operations of chance. Each is an example of a conscious creation, requiring consummate intelligence and skill. Everyone who finds it illogical to think that even a single staple came about by the proper bending of a wire by chance, will see that it is even more impossible that human beings, cats, birds, trees and the entire universe emerged by chance.\nBut today, there are people who cannot see this clear reality. Or rather they see it, but pretend not to. They claim that trees, birds, clouds, houses, cars, you yourself, others around you—in short, everything in the universe, animate and inanimate, is all the work of blind chance.\nThese people, known as Materialist-Darwinists, maintain the contradictory idea that chance occurrences can display supreme intelligence; and that the sum total of millions of chance events, occurring in sequence, can show creative power. According to Materialist-Darwinists, chance events have greater intelligence than every person in the world—no matter how many people have come and gone. They claim that a genius called ""chance"" has shaped everyone's brain, cognitive ability, judgment, memory, and countless other human characteristics for hundreds of thousands of years.\nAccording to Materialist-Darwinists, time is the only thing that this brilliant genius needs to bring about such extraordinary events. Their warped logic claims that, if given time, chance can transform a mass of inert, unconscious atoms into, for example, a fig, olive, strawberry, orange, peach, tomato, pomegranate, melon, banana, violet, tulip, orchid, or rose; into ants, butterflies, peacocks, horses, giraffes, and human beings, or any of a million other things you may not think of. Moreover, it claims that chance can bring into e",society_culture

"your feelings about the sins in the Bible? After 243 questions, i'm starting to get the way most christians interpret the bible. A sin is a sin is a sin. There is no 'in between', a sin is a sin. Because it's God's word. Ok, i begin to get that part now. (i am kinda slow in these matters, sorry)\n\nI was wondering, seriously, do you ever have a feeling about all this? Do you ever wish something God tells you to be wrong, would in fact be not all that wrong? Specially the trivial items, like wearing clothes of two different fabrics, homosexuality, eating shelfish?\n\nWouldn't life be much easier if those things were never mentioned in the Bible??\n\nDon't get me wrong, i understand that is your feeling that God's word should always be concidered as the full Truth, i just wonder how it makes you feel. Things have to be taken in context.  I agree that the wearing of mixed fabrics and refraining from shellfish are not about morality, they are about sanctity - God set the Jews out to be His people of promise.  The Messiah came through them.  It's not that God didn't have dealings with (and laws for) other nations, but the Jews were bound to certain rituals and stipulations that had more to do with symbolism than with morality.\n\nSin is any transgression against God.  All sins are the same in the sense that any of them separate me from God.  Any of them.  I hope that's what people mean when they say that all sins are equal.  Because, of course, if they were all equal in all ways, they would all carry the same penalty.  Or the same level of consequence.  Under the Old Testament law, some sins carried more weight than others.  Some would get you stoned to death and others required a payment to be made.  \n\nI believe there is also a difference between willful - premeditated - sin and being ""over-taken"" in sin.  Maybe the difference is in the heart of the person and their willingness to repent.  \n\nAll sin is equal in that it is equally undoable.  Once done, it cannot be undone.  That's why we need a clean slate, and Someone advocating on our behalf.\n\nI believe that everything commanded of us - both to do and not to do - is for our benefit.  I don't claim to know all the pros and cons of homosexuality.   I certainly don't think that homosexuals are somehow in the same mindset as murderers.  I don't hate people for their sexual orientation.  \n\nI still believe that anything we surrender to God, He uses for our ultimate good.  Willingness is the key.  I'm not saying that's easy.  \n\nI also don't believe it's the orientation itself, but the lifestyle that is sinful.  It's the same for those who are unmarried (but sexually active) who are heterosexual.  \n\nSince I believe God's word is Truth, it would be unloving of me to say that I think something is fine, when from what I can see it is condemned.  I'm not going to persecute someone for disagreeing with me, but I'm not going to lie if asked for my understanding either. \n\nThere are many things that would be easier if they weren't in the Bible.  I feel sorrowful for those who oppose the truth (as I understand it).  It isn't anything to gloat about.  I know there are some who feel that that makes me arrogant.  That's not my experience or intention.  It's not me saying I'm better.    \n\nI believe that what is in there is for me to apply to me first. It's not something to bash other people with or impose on others.\n\nThanks for asking your question the way you did.  I hope I haven't offended you - or anyone else for that matter - in my answer.",society_culture

"Which false belief concerning the Christian faith is the funniest? 1. The Bible was re-written several times over the centuries so it’s not the original book.\n\n2. Women can be preachers.\n\n3.

It's rediculous.  ""The Bible"" was organized once, and only once, to provide the most consistant group of texts so that people could have an idea of Jesus that didn't contradict itself.\n\nSure, there were many Gospels written by many different people that gave different views of Jesus and a few Jewish texts that were not included in the original version, but that does not mean that the Bible was changed over time.\n\nAlso, gays will burn in hell is a good one.

"To all Americans read this and even other nationals maybe you understand why terrorism is in Usa? The destruction of the world trade centre and the attack on the pentagon has been described as the greatest act of terrorism. \nHowever history demonstrates that the most horrific acts of Terrorism has been carried out by the freedom loving democratic nation, the United States of America . According to their own Official FBI definition of terrorism: “Terrorism is the unlawful use of force or violence against persons or property to intimidate or coerce a government, the civilian population, or any segment thereof, in furtherance of political or social objectives.” \n\nIRAQ : \nFrom 1991 to the present day the United States Air Force and Navy have slaughtered over 200,000 civilian people in Iraq with Depleted Uranium missiles, cluster bombs, cruise missiles and other so-called “smart bombs.” \n\nDuring the “Desert Storm” terror campaign the arsenal also included fuel-air bombs and napalm. \n\n177 million pounds of bombs were dropped on the people of Iraq in the most concentrated aerial bombardment in the history of the world. In the 110,000 sorties of the six-week onslaught the cowardly American and British pilots (and to a lesser extent French and Saudi pilots) mass-murdered at least 200,000 people, using depleted uranium missiles, napalm, cluster-bombs, fuel-air bombs, cruise missiles and other so-called “smart bombs.” The slaughter of civilian people in the Amariyah bomb shelter was a Prime example of this American/British state terrorism. Most of them were women, children, elderly, and invalids from a new housing development. Cowardly U.S. Navy and U.S. Air Force jet pilots caught one sixty-mile-long column of fleeing Iraqi soldiers and Palestinian civilian families in vehicles on the Kuwait to Basra highway - and pounded them ruthlessly with bombs and machine-gun fire. The road, clogged by four lanes of one-way, bumper-to-bumper traffic, was carpet bombed by B-52s dropping 1,000-pound bombs, and repeatedly hit with laser-guided missiles and “smart” bombs. All the Iraqi soldiers, as well as Palestinian workers and their families, were slaughtered without mercy. The bloodthirsty American pilots gleefully described the massacre as “shooting in a sheep pen.” \n\nDuring the Desert Storm terror campaign at least 944,000 rounds of Depleted Uranium ammo were fired from American A-10 Warthogs all over Iraq and Kuwait . When a depleted uranium tipped shell strikes a tank or armoured personnel carrier it easily penetrates the armour and burns the crew alive. The impact also vaporizes the depleted uranium, creating an aerosol of radioactive heavy-metal particles which can spread as far as 190 miles on the wind. When inhaled or ingested, the depleted uranium particles cause chemical and radioactive damage to the bronchial tree, kidneys, liver and bones. Cancer often results, and the effects can even include genetic damage. \n\nThe Dutch Laka Foundation estimates that the United States terror campaign left behind 300-800 tons of radioactive waste from this ammunition all over Kuwait and Iraq - poisoning the air, the land, the water and the people everywhere. Afterwards, wherever the depleted uranium firing had been concentrated, there were cancer epidemics among Iraqi civilians living nearby. In the ten years since then, sanctions, polluted water and depleted uranium together have killed somewhere between 1,000,000 and 2,000,000 Iraqi civilian people. At least 600,000 of the dead are children. Cancer rates have quadrupled in areas of southern Iraq bombed by the American and British state terrorists. Since it began, thousands of Iraqi babies have been born with horrible birth defects. This is something that has never before been seen in Iraq . \n\nOver the course of only 43 days and nights, approximately 62,000-80,000 air-delivered cluster bombs were dropped on the Iraqi people by the American-led state terrorists. In addition, 10,000 MLRS rockets and 100,000 “Dual Purpose Improved Conventional Munition” artill Well, I think I understand what you're conveying, and I am pretty certain I'm right.\n\nThe law of nature is that IT IS THES POWER THAT RULES.  It's not the justice, right or wrong, but POWER.  It is only those with power who can do anything they want and get away with it.  If it wasn't US, it probably would have been somebody else.\n\nAnother thing is this kind of things you're describing come from ""dark side of human nature"".  All men and women have this dark side no matter what country they belong to.  I think that's why Bible says God kept reducing human life span from several hundred years to 120 and then to current average of 70 to 80.\n\nImagine how the world would be like if murderers, thieves, gamblers and etc were to live hundreds of years.  That's why we all have to die for our own good and for good of others.  However while we're alive let's understand that we're all mortal with feet of clay and FOLLOW OUR CONSCIENCE AND COMMON SENSE.  \n\nI hope those who read my answer understands what I am conveying.",society_culture

"What if your religion is wrong? what would you do if you spent all your life worshiping Jesus, then died, only to be greeted in the afterlife by Buddha? or Allah? or Zeus?\n(feel free to switch any of these names around and add your own) According to Bhagvat Gita (Hindu religious book), where we go after we die is completely dependent upon what or who we think of just before we die!! so if we think of Jesus before we die, we will reach where Jesus is at present, and if we think of Buddha we will reach his planet!! this is a clear misconception that all people go to either heaven or hell! there are many many planets where we can go after we die , according to the actions we have performed in our lives and more specially our destination depends on what we think at the time of our death!so we dont have to worry that we will think of Jesus and reach some Buddhist planet, and greeted by Buddha!\n\n\nas far as right or wrong religion goes, well religion is a way to reach our destination!! it can be compared to a train or plane or any vehicle that we use to reach somewhere! so if we wanna go somewhere, we have to first decide which is the right transportation to reach there rather than just hop on to any transport that we can get hold of!! thats not the way! choosing the right religion is also very important! i say choosing because one should not blindly follow the religion of their parents and family but rather decide themselves about what is the best way to reach God! for that a detailed study of religion is very important! if someone doesnt do that, they might well have a fairly good chance to end up in a strange planet after they die! this life is meant to understand God and ways to reach Him! so all i can say is everybody should atleast try to find out what other religions have to say about God too! so that we can find the best and sure shot way to reach God!!",society_culture

"Do you agree with the arguements the book ""Holy Blood, Holy Grail"" presents?  Not really, it seems a desperate move to start moving letters around to fit a predetermined theory. The original grail (gradale) was a dish or plate - however, with the absence of such an artifact at some time in the past it became associated with a wine goblet (probably communion related) - then with the further absence of a suitably impressive cup it becomes the geneological blood line. In my opinion it is a dish or plate. The big question is ""why must it be kept hidden?"" The answer is that if discovered the images that are engraved into its surface will destroy the basis of the Christian religion. Consider this: Jesus existed, a clever and honest man, but his occupation was not a carpenter but a ""storyteller."" In his possession was the tool of his trade - a plate engraved with the prehistoric zodiac that preceded the present zodiac, a very ancient planisphere that had been passed down through the family for thousands of years. The images on this plate were used to form ""stories"" or even ""parables"" for others to listen to. The angels, the nativity, John the Baptist and even the crucifixion were stories that could be made up and read from the images on this plate. If this were true it would explain why the grail has never been found - it would destroy Christianity.",society_culture

The letters of the word ""Christ"" in Greek, the language in which the New Testament was written, or various titles for Jesus early became symbols of Christ and Christianity. For example, the first two letters of the word Christ (cristoV, or as it would be written in older manuscripts, CRISTOS) are the Greek letters chi (c or C) and rho (r or R)...a symbol that by the fourth century became part of the official standard of the emperor Constantine....by the fifteenth century Xmas emerged as a widely used symbol for Christmas....there is no grand scheme to dilute Christianity by promoting the use of Xmas...""\n\nI'm aware this is not a question and will be deleted, but I thought it was worth sharing.\n\n: ) Yeah, that's what I was trying to say in that other question.

"Catholic and a Mormon? Do you believe a Catholic and a Mormon can servive a relationship? I mean do you think they can make it? And can a Mormon date a catholic will his church allow it or even his parents that are strictly into the mormon church? What advice can I get from you? And thanks! I am mormon, and most of my relatives on my mothers side are catholic. We get along great, and share quite a bit in common. As with any church, the LDS (mormon) church suggests that you marry within your own faith. It just seems to make things a lot easier for both people involved. \n\nSo does the Mormon church forbid it? No, but the Church encourages its members to marry within the Church. This is sound advice in general, for the more a married couple have in common, the more likely their marriage will be successful. When a couple disagrees on basic core values and beliefs, it can lead to additional stress, conflicts, and disappointment. The issue of how kids are raised can be especially problematic. Naturally, the Church hopes they will be raised LDS. We believe that the Lord wants children to be raised with the truth of the Gospel. \nSome of the greatest blessings of the Gospel are available to married couples who both live the Gospel and are willing to receive sacred covenants made in temples. Temple marriage, for example, offers the potential to be married throughout eternity and to enjoy the blessings of family life in the presence of God. Thus, we hope that all our young people will choose to be married in the temple to a spouse who is committed to Christ and is willing to live life according to the Gospel.",society_culture

"What does this bible verse mean? Deuteronomy 22:5 A woman shall not wear men's clothing, neither shall a man put on women's clothing; for whoever does these things is an abomination to Yahweh your Father. Women were not to wear the clothing of a man or a man the clothing of a woman, a practice that might open the way for immorality, including homosexuality. (De 22:5) \nThe sim·lah′ was worn by both men and women, the woman’s being distinguishable from the man’s, perhaps in size, color, and decoration such as embroidery. God commanded that a woman should not wear a man’s garment, nor a man a woman’s mantle; this command doubtless being given in order to prevent sex abuses\n\nDoubtless the morally repugnant practice of sodomy was the reason for the severity of the rule declaring the wearing of apparel of the opposite sex to be “detestable.”",society_culture

These are called Apocrypha.  There are also many books left out of the new testament or edited in some way, there is the Gospel of Thomas and the Secret Gospel of Marc which is differently edited than the one we currently know.

"how do u know someone really loves you or if they wanna get married to you like they said they wanted to??????  A man seldom considers himself really engaged to be married until he sets a date.  So if you want to test the strength of his committment, ask him to set a date.  You may scare him off, however, so it may not be worth the risk.\n\nCan you separate his loving you from his wanting to marry you?  They are not always the same thing.  Sometimes men are not interested in marriage at all, or do not consider themselves ready for it, even though they love a woman very dearly.  Marriage is a big responsibility, and if his career is just getting started, or if he's still in college, he may think it's better to wait.  Or he may love you, but not feel monogamous commitment is right for him.  If that is the case, and if he is able to be honest about it, you may work out an ""open marriage"" arrangement.  It's a very tricky thing to make it work well, but some people really do.  I often quote an old rhyme I heard many years ago:\n\nHiggamous, hoggamous, woman's monogamous.\nHoggamous, higgamous, man is polygamous.\n\nIt has more truth to it than many people would like to admit.  That's why polygamy (a man with more than one wife) is far more common than polyandry (a woman with more than one husband).  And it makes sense from an evolutionary sense.  A woman with many husbands can still have no more than one pregnancy every nine to ten months.  A man with several wives could have each one pregnant at the same time, if he is (???) lucky.",society_culture

"outline the events of holy week and the trituum'? all the events of the holy week and the triduum. During Palm Sunday, worshipers carry palm fronds and celebrate Jesus' entry into Jerusalem. In some areas, there are pageants in which worshipers act out the parts of various Biblical characters, such as Pontius Pilate or St. Peter (sometimes, this is done in a readers'  theatre style).\n\nHoly Monday, Holy Tuesday and Holy Wednesday are somewhat understated. They may have regular prayer services, but there could be other observances during this time (Tenebrae, the Stations of the Cross, etc). \n\nMaundy Thursday is a somber celebration of the institution of the Eucharist, and the service generally concludes with the stripping of the altar.\n\nGood Friday is a very solemn service, and in some cases, statuary, crucifixes and other worship aids are draped in black. There are prayers and Scripture readings, particularly one of the Passion Gospels, and the Eucharist is made with the reserve host from Maundy Thursday. \n\nHoly Saturday is also known as the Easter Vigil. In many churches, there are baptisms and confirmations at this time. The service often begins in darkness, and the church is slowly lit with candlelight. Sometimes, bells are rung, and in other areas, it will be the first time since the beginning of Lent in which the word ""Alleluia"" can be uttered. \n\nThen comes Easter Sunday, and we all know what happens then. It is a very festive service, celebrating the resurrection of Christ.\n\nHere's a link to an introductory essay that explains the cycle of the church year:\n\nhttp://www.faithwriters.com/article-details.php?id=35824",society_culture

"Queen Elizabeth II's last name? You always here people saying Queen Elizabeth and Prince Charles... so on and so forth... but do they have a last name like Jones or Smith. Or maybe its of Wales. Do not answer that this is a stupid question. Did you know that the British royal family changed their surname (last name) in 1917?"" \n\nYes, it's true, the British royal family changed their last name from Saxe-Coburg-Gotha to Windsor in 1917. The reason? World War One broke out in 1914 and anit-German sentiment was at its height in 1917. In protest, King George V renounced all the German titles belonging to him and his family and adopted the name of his castle, Windsor. \n\nHere's a look at the proclamation: \n\n""from the date of this Our Royal Proclamation Our House and Family shall be styled and known as the House and Family of Windsor, and that all the descendants in the male line of Our said Grandmother Queen Victoria who are subjects of these Realms, other than female descendants who may marry or may have married, shall bear the said Name of Windsor ""\n\n\nWe headed back to the search results and found the British Monarchy's official web site, which explained the history of the family's surname in a bit more detail. \nThe Royal family name of Windsor was confirmed by Queen Elizabeth II after her accession in 1952. However, in 1960, The Queen and The Duke of Edinburgh decided they wanted their direct descendants to be distinguished from the rest of the Royal family (without changing the name of the Royal House), as Windsor is the surname used by all the male and unmarried female descendants of King George V. \n\nSoon thereafter, it was declared that The Queen's descendants (other than those with the style of Royal Highness and the title of Prince/Princess, or female descendants who marry) would carry the name of Mountbatten-Windsor. (In 1947, when Prince Philip of Greece took the Oath of Allegiance, he became naturalized, and assumed the name of Philip Mountbatten as a Lieutenant in the Royal Navy.) \n\n\nHope this helps",society_culture

But if this thing be true, and the tokens of virginity be not found for the damsel: Then they shall bring out the damsel to the door of her father's house, and the men of her city shall stone her with stones that she die: because she hath wrought folly Odd, isn't it, how Jesus addressed some of these 'sins' and left out others? He talked about adultery (in detail), idolatry, blasphemy, murder and keeping the sabbath, but never got around to the rest... unless, of course, his 'love one another' and 'don't judge' warnings pertained to acceptance of victimless ""sins"" such as homsexuality. \n\nMany Christians seem to believe that Jesus personally condemned homosexuality, but that came from Paul - who never met Jesus and never discussed law or morality with Jesus. That didn't stop Paul from taking over Christianity and tweaking it to suit his own personal prejudices, e.g. his attitude toward women. \n\nIf Christians are going to follow Paul they should try very hard not to marry, and if they do marry, they should avoid sex if possible, and all these female televangelists should shut up, go home and let their husbands tell them what to do.\n\nHow many Christian women wear make-up, for example? Paul (who hated gays in the NT) wrote:\n\n""I will therefore that men pray every where, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and doubting. In like manner also, that women adorn themselves in modest apparel, with shamefacedness and sobriety; not with broided hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly array;...Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection. But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the man, but to be in silence."" (1 Timothy 2-)\n\nAlso: ""Let your women keep silence in the churches: for it is not permitted unto them to speak; but they are commanded to be under obedience as also saith the law. And if they will learn any thing, let them ask their husbands at home: for it is a shame for women to speak in the church."" (1 Cor 34-35)",society_culture

The religion is known to have so many gods it is debated that there is no god at all to Hindu (among western academics), though it is so obviously a religion.\n\nGodhead is the name for the form of god in Hindu.  Godhead is in all things, all objects, all shapes, and all places.  In Hindu, god is worshipped in many shapes, the shapes of the many gods, and yet it is a general, universal god they celebrate, even though it is multitudes of gods.\n\nI understood it best when I heard a (poor) translation of a Hindu prayer, I will try to recall here: \n\n""God forgive me for these sins I commit, \nFor I am human.  \n\nYou are in all things, \nAnd I worship you in these things, \nYou are in all forms \nAnd I worship you in this form, \nYou are in all places, \nAnd I worship you in this place.  \n\nGod, forgive me for these sins I commit, \nFor I am human.""",society_culture

When your fellow christians are condemning you for being gay you should point out that none of them are living by the word of God either.

I would not be overly concerned about living or doing activities by yourself if you act and behave in a aware and self-sufficient manner.  A person is not always in control of another's behavior but don't let this keep you feeling fearful.

"Some christians say Allah is a moon god then....? Isn't YHWH/god also a moon god coz Moses use to go to mount Sinai(Sin was an ancient moongod) to talk to YHWH/God? NOT at all. Moon is one of the creation of GOD.\n\nWhat does the crescent moon in Islam symbolize?\n\nIslamic months are LUNAR not SOLAR.\nGOD created mankind for test. HE test mankind in all conditions and by any means. Unlike solar months all the seasons comes with the fixed / similar months(example if winter is in MAY then it is comes again im may, hence setting no conditions or same conditions) whereas Lunar month will move 10 days ahead of solar month every year, so if the month of fasting comes in winter then people will not feel what will happen if it comes in summer.

"Why does the Quran have so many references to the pagan mythology about the GENIE'S (JINN)? Jinn in pre-Islamic mythology:\n\nFor the ancient Semites, jinn were spirits of vanished ancient peoples who acted during the night and disappeared with the first light of dawn; they could make themselves invisible or change shape into animals at will; these spirits were commonly believed to be responsible for diseases and for the manias of some lunatics. Types of jinn include the ghul (night shade, which can change shape), the sila (which cannot change shape) and the ifrit.\n\nThe Arabs believed that the jinn were spirits of fire, although sometimes they associated them with succubi, demons in the forms of beautiful women, who visited men by night to copulate with them until they were exhausted, drawing energy from this encounter just as a vampire is supposedly sustained by his victim's blood.\n\nJinn in Islam: \n\nMuslims believe that jinn are real beings. The jinn are said to be creatures with free will, made of smokeless fire by God (the literal translation being ""subtle fire"" One thing I will say, is that you surely do study the Koran.

"Is it official Roman \nCatholic doctrine that \nunbaptized babies do not \nenter Heaven? What is the belief re: the fate of non-believers? Children who have died without Baptism, can only be entrusted to the mercy of God. Indeed, the great mercy of God who desires that all men should be saved, and Jesus' tenderness toward children which caused him to say: ""Let the children come to me, do not hinder them,"" allow us to hope that there is a way of salvation for children who have died without Baptism. All the more urgent is the Church's call not to prevent little children coming to Christ through the gift of holy Baptism. \n\na baby is a person created by God and a baby who's died did have a soul. God, if He is truly the God of love every Christian believes he is, would never forsake one who cannot argue for themselves. \n\nSt. Therese once said ""Knowing the loving God that I know, I believe hell is empty""\n\nBy the way, what I've mentioned above is actually Catholic Doctrine.

"Would destroying someone's belief in God be worse than murder? Think about it. If you were murdered and were christian, at least you would not spend eternity in hell. But for somebody to change somebody else's beliefs resulting in them going to hell wouldn't that be causing them more pain? But if you think about it, since God sends the people to hell then both the creator, the convertor, and the converted are all responible, right? I applaud you, this is a good question for philosophical thought. \n\nThe thing is, you cannot be responsible for destroying someone else's beliefs. If someone judgedthe choice to give up on their beliefs, then it is them alone who must suffer for their choice. You cannot decide whether or not someone murders you, but you can decide whether or not to continue in your beliefs.\n\nIn the case of your question; the perpetrator committing the murder would be judged accordingly by God. However, for the person trying to convert, he would be jedged based on whether or not he intentionally lied to the person he converted. Even if the converter's viewpoint is wrong, he will be judged worse if he intentionally lied to send someone to hell than if he, indeed, truly believed he was right.",society_culture

Woe to the inhabiters of the earth and of the sea! for the devil is come down unto you, having great wrath, because he knoweth that he hath but a short time. Warning now People (Clear) Revelation 12:17 And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make war with the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ. 3.

Acts 19:13-16 19:16 And the man in whom the evil spirit was leaped on them, and overcame them, and prevailed against them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded. Matthew 10:8 Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, cast out devils: freely ye have received freely give;Mark 5: 1-20 Many Devils The Demoniac Healed Mark 5:2 And when he was come out of the ship, immediately there met him out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit.5:3 (Strong) Who had his dwelling among the tombs; and no man coudl bind him, no, no with chains; 5:4 Because that he had been often bound with fetters and chains, and the chains had been plucked asunder by him, and the fetters broken in pieces; neither could any man tame him. 5:5 And always, night and day, he was in the mountains, and in the tombs, crying, and cutting himself with stones. 5:6 But when he saw jesus afar off, he ran and worshipped him, 5:7 And cried with a loud voice, and said, What have I to do with thee, Jesus, thous Son of the most high God? I adjure thee by God, that thou torment me not. 5:8 For he said unto him, Come out of the man, thou unclean spirit. 5:9 And he asked him, What is thy name?And he answered, saying, My name is Legion: for we are many. 5:10 And he besought him much that he would not send them away out of the country. 5:11 Now there was there nigh unto the mountains a great herd of swine feeding. 5:12 And all the devils besought him, saying, Send us into the swine, that we may enter into them. 5:13 And forthwith Jesus gave them leave. And the unclean spirits went out, and entered into the swine: and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the sea, (they were about two thousand;) and were choked in the sea. yes. he's real.\n\nthe sad thing is that he tempts us so easily and we for the most part fall right into the trap.

"Racism in medicine? This is a question I was left with after watching an episode of House. Foreman was treating an old black man. I forget what the condition was, but there were two possible medications for it. Number one was the regular medication, and number two was shown to be more effective than the first for black patients. Foreman prescribes number two since it is the better choice in this case, but the patient says he doesn't want a racist drug. Foreman does a song and dance and gets the guys to go home with the prescription for number two. A little while later, the patient comes back and this time sees House. This time, he refuses the 'racist drug' and demands number one. After a short fight, House gives in. However, when confronted later, he reveals that he lied to the patient and actually prescribed the racist one.\n\nMost people concerned with racism would say this is wrong, but what would the right move be? Insist on the racist one and refuse anything else, or consent and give the regular one? It is stupid, plain and simple.  That would be like insisting on fish medicine because it works a little bit, instead of that nasty racist human medicine.",society_culture

Shadow People come from somewhere else, call it a different dimension, a different world, or a different realm.  They are not from here, and they are never 100% here.

"God the HIGHEST being, eh? Okay, if God is, and always was, the highest being ever in existance, then how is it possible? I know some think that God created everything, but if nothing can come from nothing, (rather, everything has to come from SOMEWHERE) where did God come from?\n\nIf God wasn't created by someone (something) else, then could you please, without Bible references, justify your argument? As a Hindu, the teachings are that ""God"" which is often refered to as Brahman is consciousness. It is the all pervading consciousness that manifested the entire universe from its very existence. It is the nothing from which everything manifests forth and it is what everything returns to (the entire universe, everything in it). Since everything came from Brahman, then everything is equal to it. That is the saying of the Upanishads ""tat tvam asi"" or you are that. In our own innner Self is consciousness, the atman. The atman is not seperate from Brahman. The atman is Brahman. Brahman is both everything that is manifested and yet is also everything that is unmanifested. It cannot be known with our senses, only when we search our inward can we learn to discover the Atman, and thus with Atman-Realization (Self-Realization) you are then able to achieve Brahman-Realization. Brahman is the Ultimate Reality, Supreme Soul, Cosmic Consciousness (those are how it is translated into English anyways). Everything is still Brahman, everything always will be Brahman. Everything is divine, everything is interconnected. Brahman is both impersonal and personal. Brahman is all forms, and yet also is formless. Brahman is the universe, yet also pervades it. It is the source, the root. It is time, it is space, and yet it exists without it. Hindu myths of the creation of the universe (one of the many creations of the universe, because afterall this isn't the first universe to emmanate from Brahman) sounds very much like the Big Bang. So Brahman is the source from which everything came from. It is said that this is because Brahman is overflowing with creative energy and that is Its nature. Brahman wasn't created, it is all that exists right now and yet pervades it. In Hinduism they talk about consciousness not as the byproduct of the brain, but instead say that it is the mind that is the sense organ of consciousness. The brain senses the consciousness that pervades the universe...senses Brahman...and this is what gives us awareness. Prana is the life breath, what makes some of Brahman living beings and what makes other inanimate objects, but all is still Brahman. \n\nNot sure if that helps. Hindus don't think of God as the ""highest being"", they think of God as that which exists all around them and as pure consciousness. They use forms, like the statues or pictures, to help focus their mind on God, yet these statues and pictures are merely forms for us, merely symbols and tools. Brahman is everywhere. That is why in some Hindu villages where there is no temple it is not unusual for people to simply designate a tree or rock as the ""temple"" place, because Brahman exists in all things. When Hindus greet each other they say ""Namaste"" which means ""The divine in me bows and respectfully honors the divine in you."" In essence, God...Brahman...is being 'worshipped' even when greeting each other. There is a saying amongst Hindus ""Treat your mother like the goddess she is. Treat your father like the god he is. Treat your siblings like the divine they are. Treat you guests as you would god. For truly Brahman is everywhere."" The food prayer for Hindus is ""Brahman is the ritual. Brahman is the offering. Brahman is the devotee who offers to the fire which is Brahman. If a devotee sees Brahman in all things, the devotee will find Brahman.""\n\nThe word Brahman comes from Sanskrit. Brih and Manah. Brih means ""great"", ""expanding"", ""growing"" and Manah means ""consciousness"". So Brahman is ""Great Consciousness"", ""Expanding Consciousness"", ""Growing Consciousness""",society_culture

"how was muhammad ali discriminated against when he was young? for a history day project Muhammad Ali Biography\n\n    Uploaded by Sk8erD00d (665) on Dec 12, 2004 \nCassius Marcellus Clay Jr. later known as Muhammad Ali, was a black boxer, and was proud of it. Many African Americans were ashamed of their color, but Ali was different. He was the first boxer to win the Heavyweight Championship 3 different times. He had a great personality and was liked by the people. During his life, he made big decisions that changed the course of his life completely. Muhammad Ali's journey through life was a great inspiration for African American people, but Ali himself inspires admiration to everybody.\n\nMuhammad Ali was a man made to box. He had a great career before him since he made his first professional fight under President Eisenhower presidency. His Professional Career was really impressive. His had a great balance and was able to move his hands and feet in great speed and coordination. Ali was said to dance in the ring while destroying his opponents. Ali started fighting at a very short age, and his first teacher was Joe Martin (Hauser 18). Through hard work and discipline, he became a professional fighter and eventually the Heavyweight champion of the world. Although he lost the title twice, he regained it three times, putting him in the history books. His boxing career was put to an end when he started suffering from Parkinson's disease. This was the end of his boxing, but his greatness will never die.\n\nMuhammad Ali was not the kind of person that gets taken away with fame and money. He is a simple, unsophisticated person with a very loving heart, and very determined (Hauser 186). He did not care much about himself, he enjoyed making people happy. While training, he let people come and see him, charging them to see the show. Doing so, he earned about $1000 a day. After the training was over, he went home and gave away every cent to needy people, especially kids (Hauser 149). This was the kind of person Ali was. His big dream was to see peace in the country, racial peace. Also, he was not totally convinced with the idea of segregation because it is not good to make people be together against their will. This way of thinking and qualities is what Malcolm X saw in Ali, and therefore thought Ali could be a great messenger for the African Americans (Hauser 110). Ali's ideas and actions distinguished him from the rest, he was an inborn leader.\n\nDuring his life, Ali was forced to make some tough decisions, and always made them his own way. At the time of Ali's fighting, the United States were involved in the Vietnam War. As a result, young Americans were been drafted to serve in the military. When political figures saw Ali fighting, they decided to stop the hurting of our own and draft him, so he hurts the people in Vietnam. Ali was not pleased with this decision, because ha had just won the Heavyweight Championship and because he said, ""I ain't got no quarrel with them Vietcong""(Hauser 144). His final decision on the issue was that he would not go to war. He was not willing to go and kill people, while his own are in bad conditions at home. In the same way, he was forced to decide if he wanted to become a billionaire and sell his people, or to become poor and not sell his people (185). For this rebel action, his Heavyweight Title was taken away and he was put in jail. This did not matter to him because he h!\n\nad followed his beliefs and obeyed Allah. He has taught his people a lesson, and that is what satisfies him. Ali's strong beliefs cut his uprising career and took away his greatest years as a person and as a boxer.\n\nA very important quality that shapes Ali's personality is his faith in religion. Ali risked his whole career in making a choice, right or wrong. To his eyes, the correct action was to stay and face the consequences, but not go and kill innocent people. He did not agree with discrimination, and said, ""People are people: God created us all."" Ali was Musli",society_culture

"What is wrong with some form of Pascal's Wager? The only real problem I can see with Pascal's wager is that it is limited to Christianity.  However, I live a religious life (not Christian) but I am technically probably an Agnostic.  I do not KNOW 100% for sure that there is God.  But I do benefit greatly from my religious practices, and I think everyone else does to, because my practices improve my personality traits and make me a better person.  I enjoy the religious life.  It is not any kind of a burden.  It's pure joy.  \n\nI don't say that anyone else has to follow it.  So I don't USE the ""Wager"" to convince anyone else that THEY should do as I do.  But for myself, what is wrong with saying, ""I practice this religion, even though it may not be true, because it makes my life better, and I think it MAY be true""?  Furthermore, keep in mind that I am also certain that the other contenders - such as Islam and Christianity - are incorrect, and therefore I don't worry about going to hell for not being one of them. Let me applaud you for your open mindedness.  Many people would just blindly refuse everything religous or totally ignore it while you are prepared to adopt practices you consider benifitial even if you don't believe in the religion.\n\nAnyhow, the problem with Pascal's Wager is one of motivation.  Is it not better to do what is considered right not because you are looking for your own benifit after death but out of care for others.  Some would say that the curse of damnation just scares people into not doing what is considered wrong.  This has happened in the past.  The threat of damnation or promise of heaven has also been taken advantage of by those who seek power.  It is also possible people may be so afraid of damnation they refuse to do any deeds in case they may be bad but in this way stop doing good deeds.",society_culture

"In deliverance practices, who has the right to do this? a friend of mine states that all of us has the right to do deliverance. Many non-believers take an intellectual approach at refusing the Lord's Salvation. Their rationalization that salvation is for weak minded losers who can't handle their own problems and need a crutch is a dangerous thought contrary to the Word of God.\n\nRomans 14:11 For it is written, As I live, saith the Lord, every knee shall bow to me, and every tongue shall confess to God. 12 So then every one of us shall give account of himself to God.\n\nAn interesting part of this scripture is use of the words ""every"" knee and ""every"" tongue. The word ""every"" means weak minded losers and corporate presidents, academic geniuses, world leaders and mega-millionaires and anyone else drawing breath. The Word paints with a wide brush its picture of who shall give account of himself to God.\n\nWhen the Apostle Paul wrote this he was not making up a story. When he said ""it is written"", he was quoting God. Isaiah 45:23 I have sworn by myself, the word is gone out of my mouth in righteousness, and shall not return, That unto me every knee shall bow, every tongue shall swear.\n\nYou must understand ""the word is gone out of my mouth in righteousness, and shall not return,"" means what it says. He cannot and is not going to change his mind.\n\nNow that we have determined salvation is not for sissies, let's get to the good part.\n\nJohn 6:44 No man can come to me, except the Father which hath sent me, draw him: and I will raise him up at the last day.\n\nYou cannot be talked into making a decision for the Lord. Jesus said God will draw you. Take heed to your thoughts. Satan is pulling at you constantly with his deadly assertion that ""there is not hurry. Enjoy yourself and worry about God later on."" The evil one is very much involved in making sure you stay away from that Jesus stuff. \n\nJames 4:7 Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you. 8 Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you.\n\nThe Lord, however, is a gentleman. He will gently nudge at your heart and allow the Holy Spirit to draw you in the right direction. It is important to yield to that that call before it is too late. When you do, good things will start to happen. Misery will turn to peace, joy will replace agony and the love of God will begin consuming your hurts.\n\nPhilippians 4:7 And the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus. \n\nAccording to this scripture, there is no measure of the peace you will have. Even you will have trouble grasping it because God's peace is a peace beyond our understanding.\n\n1 Peter 1:8 Whom having not seen, ye love; in whom, though now ye see him not, yet believing, ye rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory:\n\nJust as you will be unable to understand the peace in your heart, there will be not words to describe the joy you have received. What a marvelous gift from the giver of all givers. Amazingly, it is all free. Your peace and joy was bought and paid for by Jesus Christ on a cross at Calvary.\n\nAnother reason people have refused the call of the Lord is because they think God is too loving and caring to send them to hell. They simply are missing the boat with that thinking. God never sent anyone to hell. People send themselves to hell by not accepting God's free gift of salvation.\n\nDeuteronomy 30:19 I call heaven and earth to record this day against you, that I have set before you life and death, blessing and cursing: therefore choose life, that both thou and thy seed may live: \n\nThe bible clearly says we have a choice. By not accepting Jesus Christ as your personal savior you are making a conscious decision to choose hell over heaven. God gives you the options and then suggests you take the ""life"" route. Imagine what it would be like trying to explain away that scripture when you are on the judgement seat.\n\nGod wants you just the way you are. He",society_culture

"Why do some see 12 year and below as sex objects? They could married to pretty women.? Some even have older girlfriends. I was messed around pretty badly by a much older guy, when I was 12. Though I know it was not my fault, I still feel that I was somehow responsible. I've never told anyone about it. I am looking for a reason, to understand and even protect the girls around me. I'm sure boys too have experienced this from other men and possibly women. So my sympathy goes out to them too. most often times when a person is sexually or physically abused a fundamental level of psycological development is missed, not fully cycled through or a person simply stops developing at that point.  Leaving them not only emotionally damaged but psychologically damaged as well.  This damage leads to a damaged idea of self as well as not only an often jaded but confused view of the world around you.  For example if a person is abused when they are preteens then developmentally they can remain there and so when they are older their mind identifies with and is attracted to people of a similar developmental stage, hence preteens... and so on... it is amazingly sad how prevalent sexual abuse is.  I once took a self development class of 88 people and out of the whole room only three had not been sexually abused.  One thing that helped me was to sit and think about and look at the even from an outside point of view and see it for what it was, with out emotion and with out blame.  I came to realize that I knew, there were several points when I knew what was happening was wrong and that it was not what I wanted and that I continued putting myself in the situation out of the desire for affection and the relationship that led to my abuse.  I realized that I had such a hunger to be loved that I was willing to put myself in a bad situation in order to get it and that was where the blame came from, I blamed myself becuase I knew and I allowed it to happen anyway.  Once I was able to sit it for what it was for me, then it was different, but I had to learn, to accept and to move on after that.",society_culture

I am a guy and I DONT think about sex all the damn time like you kids are making it out to be but guys certainly get more stimulated mentally(and physically-a boner lol) than women do.

The Spirit is as the body is to the physical realm; it is our spiritual extension and ***what receives messages from God.***  When we are ""born again"" it becomes alive -- and the good news is it's perfect!  See I Peter 1:23.  So it hears from God perfectly.\n\nThe soul has a problem called the carnal mind, which is ""enmity against God: for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.""  Paul right here is saying the Bible is crucial in telling the difference, able to divide between the two.\n\nSo like you said, we're dodging voices and we want Truth.  The Bible is crucial in this.\n\nSecondly, in John chapters 14-16, he describes the Holy Ghost as the ""teacher.""  Understanding the scriptures properly is necessary; else we are flailing this ""sword"" around in the dark.  This is where prayer comes in.  Pray for God to open up His Bible to you through the Holy Spirit.  Do so in faith.  See Matthew 7:9.  \n\nGetting to know His voice is a process and often trial and error.  Over time you recognize it and lean on it.  Let this goal be your prayer, and God will honor it!",society_culture

"what was the condition of the catholic church in 1500?  1500 was right before the start of the Protestant reformation.  Martin Luther's 95 Theses were written in 1517.\n\nThere were a couple of specific issues facing the church that started this process.  The first would have been the sale of indulgences, specifically by John Tetzel. Wikipedia has a great definition of indulgences:  ""An indulgence is the remission (either full or partial) of temporal punishment still remaining for sins after their guilt has already been removed by absolution.""  Someone could purchase an indulgence for himself or for someone else.  The church was using indulgences as a way of raising funds to build St. Peter's in Rome.\n\nSimony was another issue facing the church.  Simony can be defined as the sale and purchase of church positions such as priests.  This led to unqualified people having positions as both priests and bishops.  Remember, the mass was read in Latin, however many priests at the time did not know Latin, and were just speaking gibberish.  The practice of simony also led to the sale of indulgences as a way of paying back the pope back for a position.  The pope would issue an indulgence for the priest to sell, but the pope not only received the payment for the position, he also got a percentage of the indulgence.\n\nThe church was in a mess.  There were many in the Catholic Church who knew it needed to be reformed.",society_culture

"After reading a few aof the questions regarding halloween it has prompted me to ask this.....? Can anyone remember when firework night was one night    nov 5th?   Nowadays there are fireworks being let off all through october to december. I think fireworks should only be sold 2 days before and none after. It used to be a treat, when I was a kid now its not the same.Whats even worse is having my dogs cowering permanently for two whole months. Maybe they should make people apply for a free licence to have them on any other night than nov 5th? TOTALLY AGREE!!!!\n\nWe had a gang of children aged from 10 to 15 running around with massive fireworks setting them off sideways into cars and fences and across a main road. \nI live in a nice area but have a small patch of grass out the front of my house which is used by the kids passing through the neighbourhood. There are two very large parks nearby but the children where looking for trouble not fun!!! We had fireworks going off until 1am the other night and the police do nothing. \n\nFirstly where do they buy them from? Where are the parents? When did it become legal to sell large explosives to anyone who has money? I wonder how busy A&E are in the months of October & November with firework injures?\n\nA Licence would be a great idea, the strange thing is there are so many good displays around the country to go to which are safe and priced reasonable i wonder why people buy the crappy small ones to set off in their gardens anyway - store bought ones are alway disapointing to watch and if handed wrong very dangerous.\n\nI hope your pets recover soon.",society_culture

"Does evolution lend itself to racism? Racism is perfectly logical in evolution. \nIf races evolved because of natural selection, isn't it the case that:\n\nSome populations will be smarter than others.\n\nSome populations that have never had a written language will have less developed brains to handle it.\n\nSome populations that recently lived in a tribal environemnt have developed instincts that are better suited to that?\n\nSome populations would be poorly adapted to modern life and would resort to stealing and crime to survive.\n\nI'm playing devils' advocate - I'm not an evolutionist.

First I want to say.....WAY TO GO!!!\nIt's very hard to lose weight, you should be very proud of yourself!\nSometimes when a person loses weight they gain a lot of attention they never had before. Sometimes the person who loses weight gains more self-respect and pride. Sometimes when someone loses weight, their attitude and demeanor changes. Some people feel threatened when someone they know has gone through a major weight change, whether they gain or lose weight. Sounds like your friend feels threatened by the change in you, whether it is your weight or maybe your attitude has changed....maybe you are too confident and they feel less important to you.\nAnd maybe, she's just jealous of the fact that you have changed and she isn't getting the same attention as you. If that's the case, there really isn't anything you can do to make her feel better about herself.\nTalk to her about it, ask her what's bothering her. If you find out that she is envious of the new you, you have to decide whether you want to keep the friendship and work on it, or let her go her own way if there doesn't seem to be a solution.\nGood luck!",society_culture

Nor is there any reaonably possible way for such a vessel to be ventilated by a single tiny window.  Or even have enough for two--or seven--of every species in the world.  Or an even remotely believeable method for a handful of people to actually be able to take care of all the animals aboard the Ark for nearly a year.  \n\nNot to mention the many ancient civilizations like the Chinese and the Summerians who somehow managed to keep right of going and not even notice their own desrtruction.\n\nThe more you look closely at the tale, the more ""Godmagic"" you have to invoke in your effort to explain away the real-world problems of the story.

What the Creationists convienently overlook is the wide variety of differences between all the flood stories...the number of survivors ranges from two to entire tribes, the details of the source of the floods and the motives of the gods that cause them are all different, etc...

He is the greatest deceiver of all time.\n\nHe even managed to get Christians to include some pagan holidays in their practices to give non believers some ammunition to use against Christians. What better way to discredit any group than to sneak in something erroneous and later use it to question the accuracy of the entire organization.\n\nChristmas season as we know it was a pagan festival even before the time of Christ. Supposedly Jesus' birth occurred  in the spring, not in December. Many years ago officials anxious to convert pagans to Christianity slowly introduced a festival that coincided with the same date as the pagan one and in time it became ""Christmas"".  That is not from God it is from humans who had good intentions but may have been a bit misguided in their understanding of Gods' will.  \n\nSo now we observe Christmas on December 25 out of tradition not out of historical accuracy. The date is now questionable but the season is sincere at least to devoted Christians.

"did thanksgiving originate in the U.S. or brought over from Europe?  Although there is record of earlier thanksgiving celebrations (most notably in 1619 at Berkeley Plantation, Virginia), Americans trace their traditional Thanksgiving holiday to one celebrated in 1621. This celebration was held at the Plymouth Colony, now in the state of Massachusetts. The English Pilgrims who had founded the colony marked the occasion by feasting with Native American guests—members of the Wampanoag tribe—who brought gifts of food as a gesture of goodwill. Although this event was an important part of American colonial history, there is no evidence that any of the participants thought of the feast as a thanksgiving celebration. Two years later, during a period of drought, a day of fasting and prayer was changed to one of thanksgiving because rains came during the prayers. Gradually the custom prevailed among New Englanders to annually celebrate Thanksgiving after the harvest.\n\nColonial governments and, later, state governments took up the Puritan custom of designating thanksgiving days to commemorate various public events. Gradually the tradition of holding annual thanksgiving holidays spread throughout New England and into other states. During the American Revolution (1775-1783) the Continental Congress proclaimed a national day of thanksgiving following the American victory at the Battle of Saratoga in 1777. U.S. president George Washington proclaimed another day of thanksgiving in 1789 in honor of the ratification of the Constitution of the United States. In 1817 New York State adopted Thanksgiving Day as an annual custom, and many other states soon did the same. Most of the state celebrations were held in November, but not always on the same day.\n\nIn the mid-19th century Sarah Josepha Hale, editor of Godey’s Ladies Book, led a movement to establish Thanksgiving as a national holiday. In 1863, during the American Civil War (1861-1865), President Abraham Lincoln proclaimed the last Thursday in November to be Thanksgiving Day in order to bolster the Union’s morale. After the war, Congress established Thanksgiving as a national holiday, but widespread national observance caught on only gradually. Many Southerners saw the new holiday as an attempt to impose Northern customs on them. However, in the late 19th century Thanksgiving’s emphasis on home and family appealed to many people throughout the United States. As a distinctly American holiday, Thanksgiving was also considered an introduction to American values for the millions of immigrants then entering the country.",society_culture
"If Adam & Eve were the first 2 people on Earth....? Does that mean mankind grew out of incest commited by their offspring? I believe that a literal interpretation of Genesis is ignorant.  I believe that Genesis is a Christian mythology and I have scholars on my side.  The whole creation story is symbolic.  When it was written, we didn't have science to explain how the earth or its inhabitants were created, so the writer had to explain it in a way that people living at the time would understand.  The Adam and Eve story, I believe is symbolic of emerging societies.  Adam and Eve living in paradise are symbolic to small nomadic groups of people living apart from each other.  They are kicked out of paradise when nomadic groups began to experience conditions that threatened their survival - hot sun, cold winters and learned about the fragility of life and death.  They had two children, Cain and Able - this symbolizes the population getting larger and when Cain killed Able, this is symbolic for fighting and wars between individuals and groups of people with differing ideas.",society_culture
"Do you have an opinion ??? please answer , give a good answer? see i need this for class i just need thoughts or what you think about this and why , please \n\nHERES THE QUESTION , PLEASE ANSWER THE WHOLE QUESTION , OR AT LEAST AN OPION \n\nWHAT IF PEOPLE WHERE SO COMPLETELEY CONTROLLED BY A POWERFUL GOVERMENT WAS JUST LIKE  EVERYONE ELSE ?,  WHAT IF ALL COMPETION WERE REMOVED FROM SOCIETY ? WHAT IF TECHNOLOGY  BECAME SO ADVANCE THAT IT COULD READ THOUGHTS ? It isn't a question, but three.\n\n-  What if people were (misspelling) so completely controlled by a powerful government (I can't understand the rest WHAT is like everyone else)?  Maybe you mean that everyone would be like everyone else?\n\nThe simple answer is Communism, a failed political and economic system.  The system fails because it doesn't encourage competition or development.  With complete government control all resources would be divided by the government or used for their projects.  There is always a limit on resources, not everyone in the US can get a cell phone, a big screen TV, and HDTV service.  Some people just can’t afford it all.  So some people have to do without.  Who determines how much of a resources is needed for a task.  If a building required all the available wood in the region then it would be sent there, but since the boss likes to make birdhouses he takes some for himself.  So what happens to you when you can’t get the wood to build your doghouse, or to repair your own house?\n\nAnother big problem is that since there are always shortages in a non-perfect supply system it encourages corruption.  In the above situation the boss might save some wood for you in return for sexual favors, is that fair?  There are only so many doctors available, so who would decide which one gets treatment?  The people in power would get the best health care and those who were not in power would have to make do with the rest.  All the best equipment and medicines would be transferred to those hospitals with the result of people dieing, when they could have been saved.  Is this fair, well if you are a family member of one of the rulers then it would seem fair to you?  Who would decide?\n\nIt is impossible to make everyone just like everyone else.  If you do that then the smart people would have to acts less intelligent, while the less intelligent would be responsible for more than they can handle.  How do you change everyone’s looks, say goodbye to beauty; everyone would look just the same.  If a government had this power then they would make all redheads and all blondes dye their hair black or brunette.  What happens to those with perfect vision?  Most people don’t have perfect vision, it deteriorates with time and eventually some people won’t be able to get it corrected to 20/20.  So what do you plan on doing?  Do you make everyone wear glasses so their vision will all be downgraded or upgraded to the norm?  What about the blind, or do you just kill them all off?\n\n-  What if all competition was removed from society?\n\nAgain communism is the simple answer.\nAnother good answer is illustrated by the TV Show (PBS) Guns, Germs and Steel.  The reason why most primitive societies haven't advanced as far as others is because they didn't need to.  The pressures of their environment are less so they don't need to improve things.  When all you have to do for breakfast is go outside and chuck a spear then why invent a supermarket, and all that is required to build it?  Why bother to invent a brass spear or even a rock knife if you didn’t need it?\n\nCompetition forces advancements and development (as per Darwin's theory of Evolution).  Without competition the species stagnates and eventually dies.  Why run the race when you can’t win, why bother to enter the race at all?  The points on Yahoo Answers don’t mean very much, but most people like to gather points for bragging rights.  If there wasn’t a point system then why bother to answer any questions, or ask them?  Competition is basic to what we do and how we live.  Viruses compete against the body’s immune system.  When your body defeats a virus then it keeps immunity to that virus for a very long time.  Once you get Chicken Pox then you are immune to them.  Without that competition you could get infected every single time you are exposed.  The same is true in our society competition is needed to improve.\n\n-  What if technolo",society_culture

"religiously speaking, what is the difference between sunni and shi'ite? ? The division happened after Muhammad's death.\n\n17 The prophet’s death provoked a crisis. He died without any male progeny and without a clearly designated successor. As Philip Hitti states: “The caliphate [office of caliph] is therefore the oldest problem Islam had to face. It is still a living issue. . . . In the words of Muslim historian al-Shahrastani [1086-1153]: ‘Never was there an Islamic issue which brought about more bloodshed than the caliphate (imamah).’” How was the problem solved back there in 632 C.E.? “Abu-Bakr . . . was designated (June 8, 632) Muhammad’s successor by some form of election in which those leaders present at the capital, al-Madinah, took part.”—History of the Arabs.\n\n18 The successor to the prophet would be a ruler, a khalifah, or caliph. However, the question of the true successors to Muhammad became a cause for divisions in the ranks of Islam. The Sunni Muslims accept the principle of elective office rather than blood descent from the prophet. Therefore they believe that the first three caliphs, Abu Bakr (Muhammad’s father-in-law), `Umar (the prophet’s adviser), and `Uthman (the prophet’s son-in-law), were the legitimate successors to Muhammad.\n\n19 That claim is contested by the Shi`ite Muslims, who say that the true leadership comes through the prophet’s blood line and through his cousin and son-in-law, `Ali ibn Abi Talib, the first imam (leader and successor), who married Muhammad’s favorite daughter, Fatimah. Their marriage produced Muhammad’s grandsons Hasan and Husayn. The Shi`ites also claim “that from the beginning Allah and His Prophet had clearly designated `Ali as the only legitimate successor but that the first three caliphs had cheated him out of his rightful office.” (History of the Arabs) Of course, the Sunni Muslims view that differently.\n\n20 What happened to `Ali? During his rule as the fourth caliph (656-661 C.E.), a struggle over leadership arose between him and the governor of Syria, Mu`awiyah. They joined battle, and then to spare further Muslim bloodshed, they threw their dispute open to arbitration. `Ali’s acceptance of arbitration weakened his case and alienated many of his followers, including the Khawarij (Seceders), who became his deadly foes. In the year 661 C.E., `Ali was murdered with a poisoned sabre by a Khariji zealot. The two groups (the Sunni and the Shi`ah) were at loggerheads. The Sunni branch of Islam then chose a leader from the Umayyads, wealthy Meccan chiefs, who were outside of the prophet’s family.\n\n21 For the Shi`ah, `Ali’s firstborn, Hasan, the prophet’s grandson, was the true successor. However, he resigned and was murdered. His brother Husayn became the new imam, but he too was killed, by Umayyad troops on October 10, 680 C.E. His death or martyrdom, as the Shi`ah view it, has had a significant effect on the Shi`at `Ali, the party of `Ali, down to this day. They believe that `Ali was the true successor to Muhammad and the first “imam [leader] divinely protected against error and sin.” `Ali and his successors were considered by the Shi`ah to be infallible teachers with “the divine gift of impeccability.” The largest segment of the Shi`ah believe that there have been only 12 true imams, and the last of these, Muhammad al-Muntazar, disappeared (878 C.E.) “in the cave of the great mosque at Samarra without leaving offspring.” Thus “he became ‘the hidden (mustatir)’ or ‘the expected (muntazar) imam.’ . . . In due time he will appear as the Mahdi (divinely guided one) to restore true Islam, conquer the whole world and usher in a short millennium before the end of all things.”—History of the Arabs.\n\n22 Every year, the Shi`ah commemorate the martyrdom of Imam Husayn. They have processions in which some cut themselves with knives and swords and otherwise inflict suffering on themselves. In more modern times, Shi`ite Muslims have received much publicity because o",society_culture

"The positions of major religion? Let's see ...\nThe Jews doesn't recognize Jesus as the Messiah, with that also they don't recognize Muhammad as a prophet, The Jews only believes in the Torah (Old Testament, If I'm not mistaken) but didn't even bother to look at the bible and the quran. \nChristians  recognize Jesus as the Messiah, but doesn't recognize Muhammad as a prophet Christians believe in the Old Testament(Torah)and new Testament(Bible) but doesn't think that the quran is God's word. The Moslems recognize Jesus as the Messiah (Christ, Al-Masih) and also recognize the Torah and The Bible(Injil, in Islamic words) as God's word. Interesting, huh? What do you guys think? The asker is right when referring Muslims recognizing Jesus (PBUH) as the messiah because each religion has their own view of the meaning of messiah @ al-masih. Read http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messiah . Islam recognizes Jesus (PBUH) as a prophet, not as the son of Lord God. Hence, Islam still recognizes Jesus (PBUH) and is not considered as Christians. Yes, the Tanakh (Old Testament) is being added by Christians (New Testament) and Muslims believe in the Torah (in Islam, it is called the Taurat) but after Quran was being given to Muhammad (PBUH) all of the rules in the earlier scriptures are abolished and human beings are to adhere to the Holy Quran because it is the most complete scripture among all four scriptures (Zabur, Taurat, Injil and Quran).

"Do you believe you can be delivered from physical pain? Many of us have lived relatively easy lives. And think it would be unjust for\nGod to let us suffer a while, since we are believers. But the Word makes it clear\nthere will be some suffering.\nAnd those who ""die"" in Christ will be raised first, and together with those who\nare alive, will be caught up together with the Lord!""\n I had a freind who got electrocuted on a construction job. He said his\nspirit jumped out, and he watched himself getting shocked.\nAn African woman spoke one time and said she was getting beaten for her\nfaith. But God took her spirit out of her, and she watched herself being\nbeaten, and was spared most of the pain.\nDo you believe God can do that for you? Or will we get angry when the\nsuffering comes and curse God? Dear Solomon R.:  I DO believe God through his Greatest Teacher and the Partnership of the Holy Spirit CAN do that for us.\n\nI am a Christian and Spiritually oriented person.  My path is alive through ""tight"" relationships with both the Holy Spirit and Jesus.  Many do not know. . ., but Jesus and the Holy Spirit can and DO teach something non-traditional religions have named Transcendence.\n\nWill you bear with me, if I expand a picture for you to look upon and possibly contemplate?\n\nThe Crucifixion is looked upon as physical torture - to the degree that we have to turn away, and hold on to ourselves.  Many learn to love Him by witnessing the pain aspect.  Some love Him without dwelling upon it.  The meaning of the Crucifixion is far greater than the seeming display of physical vulnerability and pain:  Our vulnerability to each other and to our bodies.\n\nThe Crucifixion was undertaken by Him as the greatest learning tool He could use and teach by.  After the people saw  the ultimate physical abuse taking place - to an extent that leads to death - He then offered the Final Statement:  What God Created. . . cannot be destroyed.  The physical is perishable, but not what God Created.  Notice. . .He reappeared in his physical image again, and remained in it until He desired to leave.  Note:  The physical image he appeared in contained a ""hole"" for the others to see, but the blood, the bruising, the torn and tattered flesh were all absent !\n\nInside of us, and coupled with our human Intellect is a thing called soul or spirit.  Jesus and the Holy Spirit teach how to live through that - more than through the logic of the Intellect.  They both SERVE us in this physical life - the Intellect and the Soul.\n\nJesus can also TEACH how to use our God-given soul or Spirit-Mind to block out or transcend the pains of the physical.  He willingly teaches that WE ARE NOT VULNERABLE ;  to each other, or to the human Intellect !  Not all of us become Masters as He did and master life.  But, Jesus can teach level upon level of God's Thoughts and Knowledge to us - IF we choose to learn it, and ask for that.  \n\nPresently, I am working on that very thing.  Transcendence and Detachment.  To do this, you must have something to ""go up against.""  Something to test against.  I have experienced the inflictions of physical pain - and, according to His instruction, through my Mind, have learned to ""banish"" it.  Many, many of us have learned this.  Ghandi spoke of the horrifying beatings he received at the hands of his opposers.  He was taken to the hospital more than once so bruised, bloodied and purpled that it was not understood how he bore the pain.  He said, that although the body showed the infliction - he did not FEEL it !  We have no idea how powerful our souls or spirit-minds are.  And the joy of tapping into its power.  Many non-notable people, as you have mentioned, and now me too (!) have experienced the gifts of Spirit and some degree of Mastery over the physical.  It's real.\n\nWhen we are taught that after Ascension Jesus rose to rest and sit at the right hand of God and is no longer teaching on earth - we should be aware that there is a slight mis-perception in that.  He DID go before our Creator.  He was allowed to ""speak"" with Him.  But, He was quickly placed in charge of the Sonship and ceaselessly and intensely teaches us through Mind-to-Mind.  We receive His tutoring when we invite Him and then learn to hear his voice through our mind.  \n\nThe Sons of Man (Us) are much more. . .than we appear to be.  Something else Created our Minds.\n\nBest regards, Lana",society_culture

From the Jewish TORAH and TALMUD (which is one of Judaisms Holy Books!).\n\nShabbath 19:2 \nThey may perform on the Sabbath all things that are needful for circumcision: excision, tearing, sucking [the wound], and putting thereon a bandage and cumin. If this had not been pounded up on the eve of the Sabbath a man may chew it with his teeth and then apply it. \n\nShabbat 133B \nII.1. \nA. Suck [out the wound]: \nB. Said R.

"does the cathlic church still offer sanctuary?  Yes they do.  All throughout history the Catholic Church has been a place of refuge for those seeking shelter.  In World War Two the Catholic Church offered sanctuary to the Jews escaping nazi persecution and in Poland under Nazi and then communist control. More recently Manuel Noriega comes to mind. Today in Africa many people suffering persecution are taking refuge in catholic churches as we speak.\n\nSanctuary is not just a Christian principle or even a Catholic one. \n\nIt has been offered by many other religions, including temples of Osiris in Egypt, and certain Greek temples like the Temple of Apollo. Sanctuary was only good so long as they remained in the church. If they were to ever leave the church, the authorities would grab them. Originally, some people who used sanctuary would then join the church, and stay cloistered within it. To do otherwise would mean capture by the authorities. \n\nToday it is not ""officially"" recognized, but there is still a respect for the church and religious buildings, and storming these buildings is really considered by most people and authorities, Verboten (Forbidden).

"What's a heterosexual? anyone? Heterosexuality primarily refers to aesthetic, sexual and romantic attraction exclusively between two individuals of differing genders. It is characterised as a sexual orientation, contrasted with homosexuality and bisexuality. The concept has its roots in the 19th century tradition of personality taxonomy.\n\ncomes from the Greek word heteros, meaning ""different"" (for other uses, see heterozygote, heterogeneous), and the Latin for sex (that is, characteristic sex or sexual differentiation). The term ""heterosexual"" was coined shortly after and opposite to the word ""homosexual"" by Karl Maria Kertbeny in 1868 and was first published in 1869. ""Heterosexual"" was first listed in Merriam-Webster's New International Dictionary as a medical term for ""morbid sexual passion for one of the opposite sex"", but in 1934 in their Second Edition Unabridged it is a ""manifestation of sexual passion for one of the opposite sex; normal sexuality"". (Katz, 1995)\n\nHeterosexuality, like any forms of identity is very subjective. In western society, one is generally thought of as heterosexual if one derives either all, or the vast majority of their erotic and/or sexual stimulation from people of the different sex to them. In other cultures a heterosexual man may engage in homosexual intercourse provided that he keeps the role traditionally assigned to his sex during intercourse and his gender during the surrounding relationship. Also, in some cultures a heterosexually identifying man may assume any role during homosexual congress as a social action provided he maintain a relationship with a woman in his family life. Cultural allowances such as this have been historically rarer amongst women, but more recently have been tolerated more than the male equivalents largely because of its connection to some schools of feminism.\n\nDefinitions of sexuality tend to be narrower to most heterosexuals than it is to people of other sexual orientations. In most cases a potential partner's sex is determined wholly by anatomic sex at birth and genetic sex. Many heterosexuals would argue that one whose determination of a partner's sex deviates from that criterion cannot truly be heterosexual. Transgendered people and even those with many natural intersex conditions are very rarely seen as potential mates by heterosexuals, even those who consider themselves tolerant and accepting to such identities.\n\nHistory and demographics\n\nThe prevalence of exclusive heterosexuality has varied over the centuries and also from culture to culture.\nThough there have always been individuals (sometimes in a majority, sometimes in a minority) who were exclusively attracted to those of the opposite sex, heterosexuality as an identity (just like homosexuality) has developed only since the middle of the nineteenth century.\n\nThe history of heterosexuality is part of the history of sexuality. That history and science derivative of it is far from complete. Owing to complications of human politics and prejudice, coupled with the malleable nature of human behaviour, it will be some time before the history and nature of all forms of human sexual behaviour are truly known.\n\nPsychological factors relating to sexuality\nA broad array of opinion holds that much human behavior ultimately is explainable in terms of natural selection. From this point of view, the shifting social balance between heterosexual and homosexual desire has evolved as a fitter survival strategy for the species than either an exclusively heterosexual or homosexual configuration of desire.\n\nIn traditional societies individuals are often under heavy social pressure to marry and have children, irrespective of their sexual orientation. In modern society, many homosexual people who wish to have children have found a way to satisfy their nurturing instincts, either through fostering or adopting children, or through artificial or natural insemination.\n\n",society_culture

Normally when we die, bacteria and other germs eat away at the soft tissues (such as skin and muscles) leaving only the bones behind. Since bacteria need water in order to grow, mummification usually happens if the body dries out quickly after death. The body may then be so well preserved that we can even tell how the dead person may have looked in life.\n\nMummies are made naturally or by embalming, which is any process that people use to help preserve a dead body. Mummies can be dried out by extreme cold, by the sun, by smoke, or using chemicals such as natron. Some bodies become mummies because there were favorable natural conditions when they died.

"If God forgives everybody, who goes to hell? If God forgives everybody no matter what, then who goes to hell? The people that don't repent their sins? If so, that doesn't seem to very Catholic. I mean, if God's motto is to forgive everybody no matter what, why would you subject them to excruciating pain for all eternity because they might not love God? That's not very nice.\n\nSorry, I'm only 14. I don't know much about my faith just yet, but this really bothers me. It bothers you because you have the answer in your heart! Of course God wouldn't do that. But religion will tell you otherwise to try and control you with fear. He cannot be loving and forgiving and also send people to hell. That wouldn't make him the conqueror over sin would it? \n\nWho won, Satan or Jesus? Jesus saved the world and that is that. People just don't want to believe that they are free and loved. They want to do good things and be rewarded for them. And they want to be punished for being bad, or see other people being punished. Would you send someone from your family to hell - for anything?

"Which is better, to do the right thing for the wrong reason, or the wrong thing for the right reason?  That is a thought-provoking question.  The answer necessarily pivots on the definition of right and wrong.  Who determines the standard?  The laws of a certain land may say this particular act is right – acceptable.  A higher authority (if one accepts such) may say it is wrong.  Without ascertaining who sets the standard, there is no frame of reference within which to respond to the question.\n\nMoreover, if one were to say it is alright to do the wrong thing for the right reason, the implication is that sincerity and heart-felt motive outweigh the standard.  But is that really so?  It all points back to the standard - there must be a standard first and the one who sets the standard must have the authority to do so and the ability to enforce it.  Else, the question, in effect, becomes meaningless.",society_culture

That would be a tough existence indeed.\n\nI do not choose to define you by this one question, as most the rest of the answerers seem to have.\n\nYou may be interested to know - or you may already know - God has destroyed relatively large groups of people in the past who were involved in wicked things such as child sacrifice (as in the case of the Canaanites), debased sexual wrongs (as in the case of Sodom and Gomorrah) and extreme violence and physical abuse (as in the case of the flood) among other things.\n\nIt certainly is unfair that righteous, meek people must be constantly affected by people who choose to ruin themselves, others and this planet.  But the Bible, at Revelation 11:18, explains that God will soon ""bring to ruin those ruining the earth.""\n\nPsalm 37:10, 11, 29 says, ""And just a little while longer and the wicked will be no more; and you will certainly give attention to his place and he will not be.  But the meek ones themselves will possess the earth and they will find exquisite delight in the abundance of peace...The righteous themselves will possess the earth and they will reside forever upon it.""\n\nJust how many people on the earth today are ""wicked"" and how many are ""righteous?""  We cannot know the number or the percentage precisely, but the Bible makes it clear that the majority of mankind is on the ""wide and spacious road leading to destruction"" and very few are on the ""narrow and cramped road leading to life."" (Matthew 7:13)\n\nHowever, you can gain a lot of peace by adopting God's view of the situation.  Though he will do what is necessary to clean up the earth and make life worth living for those who are willing to meet his requirements, ""Jehovah is not slow respecting his promise, as some people consider slowness, but he is patient with you because he does not wish any to be destroyed, but desires all to attain to repentance."" (2 Peter 3:9)\n\nIf you look at people causing you hardship or pain of any kind as people who potentially will eventually see the light of truth and make changes for the better, just like Saul who later became known as the Apostle Paul, you will find greater joy in life now.\n\nI highly recommend you get yourself a copy of the book called What Does the Bible Really Teach?

"why did Mohammad of Islam need 9 wives when he preaches to muslims to have only 4 wives?  I did not intend to answer this question if someone had already given a satisfying answer.‎\n\nFirst, I have to admire you for the excellent question since it is a misconception that ‎many non-Muslims carry about Islam.‎\n\nNow, you question uses the word ""need"" rather than ""had"". That would make a difference ‎in the answer.‎\n\nIf you indeed meant ""need"", you first need to know few facts. The Prophet Mohammad ‎‎(peace be upon him) first married at the age of 25 a woman that is 15 years older than ‎him. His first wife was married twice and had children from her ex-husbands. His ‎marriage lasted until he turned 50 when his wife died. He stayed two years before ‎marrying an 80 year old woman. So, the Prophet lived 52 years and married only one woman. The Prophet ‎died at the age of 63; by that time, he had nine wives. The Prophet had several wives for ‎several reasons; one reason was to build a solid political relation with other tribes or ‎nations (do you know that one of the Prophet's wives was a Christian and another was ‎Jewish?); another reason was to build a social bond with his followers by marrying their ‎sisters or daughters; another important reason was for his wives to convey all the ‎important lessons of building a family to a nation that reached a population of 2 billion; ‎he could not have done all of this with one wife.‎\n\nHowever, if you meant, ""why did Mohammad of Islam had 9 wives ..."", then the ‎referenced source below will give you the answer. The translation of the verse in English ‎states:‎\n\n‎""It is not lawful for thee to marry more women after this, nor to change them for other ‎wives, even though their beauty attract thee, except any thy right hand should possess as ‎hand-maidens: and Allah doth watch over all things.""‎\n\nIt might be difficult for you to comprehend the meaning of the above verse, but to ‎understand it better, you should know that the Qur'an (the words of God) was revealed to ‎the Prophet (pbuh) by Gabriel on a span of 23 years. By the ‎time the translated verse above was revealed, the Prophet (pbuh) had nine wives. God ‎‎(Allah) advised the Prophet (pbuh) on this verse that he should not marry more women or ‎even divorce one with the intention of marrying a more beautiful woman.‎\n\nNow, you might ask, ""when the verse was revealed to him, why then he did not divorce five to satisfy this verse?"" That would ‎also be a good question. To answer this, you should understand that divorce is the last ‎solution in Islam to end a bad marriage; why then divorce if the marriage was a good ‎one? The Prophet Mohammad (pbuh) had a model marriage with his wives.‎\n\nLet me explain this from a different perspective with a similar case that comes to mind. I ‎heard that the Chinese Government restricts the people of China from having more than a ‎certain number of children (I do not know if this is still true). Now imagine that you are a ‎Chinese with nine obedient and loving children, then this rule was enforced for the first ‎time so that you should not have more than four children; would you kill the other five ‎just to satisfy your government regulation?‎",society_culture

"Don't people talking on cellphones in public place realize they are being rude?? I seriously can not beleive how rude some people are about talking on their cellphones. They take them into public places like malls or grocery stores or movie theatres and just loudly talk away, not seeming to realize how much they are annoying other people. Worst of all are those stupid headsets, so people can walk around loudly talking to nobody about personal things no one wants to hear about.\n\nAnd like when I'm cahsiering at work, sometimes people will come up to me and have me ring up their sale... WHILE they are talking to somone on their cellphone. And when I try to ask them a question about their purchase, they'll just look at me like, ""What? Can't you see I'm on the phone here??""\n\nSeriously, what is people's problems? Can't they see they are being rude? Or do they just not care? I don't know what some people's problem is!  At the last college I went to, there was this guy (40-something years old) that was ALWAYS on his phone in the hallway or the courtyard or the cafeteria.  And he would always be talking incredibly loudly, so you were pretty much forced to listen to his conversation, and a lot of them were inappropriate.  I finally walked up to him and told him off after he was outside one day talking (more like shouting, actually) about some co-worker of his who had a pelvic exam and all her gynecological problems... and used her first and last name and phone number. I told him that I didn't know who that lady was, but I was pretty sure she didn't want me and the rest of the world knowing about all her personal business.  And the guy just kind of shrugged and went on his way, and told whoever he was talking to about how some ""little girl""(me) was trying to teach him manners!\nAnd BlueTooth/handsfree users can be so obnoxious too!  Especially the ones who have super tiny headsets and look toward you while saying something like ""Hi! How are you?"" and then get annoyed when you respond!  \nI totally understand that people like having cell phones, I use mine pretty frequently, but I wish they would keep in mind that they are still in public, and they need to be polite to the people around them.",society_culture

Also, monotheism did not exist for a long time and even when a belief in one God did exist it was eclipsed by polytheism. So according to scripture, are all of these people damned to hell?

"When was the first Valentine held? From where the word derived? And how did it come about? Where was it held?  History\n[edit]\n\nFebruary fertility festivals\n\nThe association of the middle of February with love and fertility dates to ancient times. In the calendar of Ancient Athens, the period between mid January and mid February was the month of Gamelion, which was dedicated to the sacred marriage of Zeus and Hera.\n\nIn Ancient Rome, the day of February 15 was Lupercalia, the festival of Lupercus, the god of fertility, who was represented by two half-naked young men, dressed in goat skins. As part of the purification ritual, the priests of Lupercus would sacrifice goats to the god, and after drinking wine, they chose two young men to run through the streets of Rome holding pieces of the goat skin above their heads, striking anyone they met with the goat hide. Young women especially would come forth voluntarily for the occasion, in the belief that being so touched would render them fruitful and bring easy childbirth.\n\nAccording to the Catholic Encyclopedia (1908), at least three different Saint Valentines, all of them martyrs and all quite obscure, are mentioned in the early martyrologies under the date of February 14:\n\n    * a priest in Rome who suffered martyrdom in the second half of the 3rd century and was buried on the Via Flaminia.\n    * a bishop of Interamna (modern Terni) also suffered martyrdom in the second half of the 3rd century and was also buried on the Via Flaminia, but in a different location than the priest.\n    * a martyr in North Africa, about whom little else is known.\n\nThe connection between St. Valentine and romantic love is not mentioned in any early histories and is regarded by secular historians as purely a matter of legend (see below). The feast of St. Valentine was first declared to be on February 14 by Pope Gelasius I in 496. There is a widespread legend that he created the day to counter the practice held on Lupercalia of young men and women pairing off as lovers by drawing their names out of an urn, but this practice is not attested in any sources from that era.\n\nIn the 19th century, relics of St. Valentine were donated by Pope Gregory XVI to the Whitefriar Street Carmelite Church in Dublin, Ireland, which has become a popular place of pilgrimage on February 14.\n\nIn 1969, as part of a larger effort to pare down the number of saint days of purely legendary origin, the Church removed St. Valentine's Day as an official holiday from its calendar",society_culture

"Why does God Kills?? Let's say you believe in God and the Bible. So, if he created mankind (and it turned to be an imperfect creation) how come he sent a worldwide, Earth-covering, global Flood that destroyed all terrestrial, air-breathing creatures (not only all mankind), with the exception of those on the Ark, in addition to the whole Earth itself (Gen. 6:3, 6-7,11-13, 17/ 7:21-23/ 1 Pet. 3:20/ 2 Pet. 3:6). I mean, isn't that the worst genocide in history by far? If you read all of the verses that you quoted, you would've found your answer there.  FYI- the babies/children (all people who have not reached the age of accountability) were safe - they went to heaven.\n\nGod sent the flood because of the fallen angels that left heaven and came to earth to have children with the daughters of Adam and Eve. The offspring of this union were the Nephilim or giants (Genesis 6:1-4 and Jude v6). This was an attempt by Satan to pollute the blood line of Adam and Eve which is the same blood line that Jesus Christ came from (Luke 3:23-38).\n\nADDED on March 1st - Ok.  If you studied your Bible you would know the answer to your question.  Yes,God is a loving God. The Bible also says that He is a God of wrath.  God is a jealous God.  God made man in His image - where do you think man got all of this from?  Why are you angry?  Because God gets angry with us when we openly sin and show complete disregard for Him. God can do whatever and not have to answer to anyone - but, everything that He does has a beautiful and perfect purpose.  Since we humans have a finite sense of time (everything really), we can't grasp His wonderful plan. "" Those who reject Him receive the punishment they deserve (John 3:18,36). Those who believe are receiving far more. No one, though, is being punished beyond what they deserve. So, this is fair. I invite you to read the parable found in Matthew chapter 20, verses 1-16.  In our minds, that is not fair. It is an example, though, of God being gracious to some and fair to everyone.""",society_culture

"Who here loves 1st Samuel 15:3?? ""Now go and smite non-believers, and utterly destroy all that they have, and spare them not; but slay both man and woman, infant and suckling.""\n\nIs this how we know God really loves us? Nice try, but what you're trying won't work. God said AMALEKITES for a reason. God told Saul to smite the AMALEKITES in particular for a reason. Before you talk about I Samuel 15:3, why don't you read I Samuel 15:2? In this verse, God says that he remembers a transgression that the Amalekites had committed against the Israelites; right after their liberation from Egypt, they had lain in wait for them. The Amalekites had also slain many of the Israelites, though that was, in part, due to God's punishment. Because the Amalekites lay in wait to harm Israel, God had to fulfill the promise to Abraham that he would bless his children (the Israelites) who blessed them, but would also curse those who cursed them. Therefore, God was delivering his punishment for the Amalekites harming Israel. This is why God orders the utter destruction of the people; it is retribution fot an offense committed against Israel a long time ago.\nThis Bible verse in no way compares to the Quran. God never orders the Israelites to slay them in order to spread religion, as Muhammad had done (which is justified by the Quran). God had done it as punishment, not as a way to spread religion. Your replacement of Amalekites with non-believers gives the reader the impression that that verse of the Bible promotes murder for the spread of Judaism and/or Christianity, which is not the case. Your use of the phrase ""non-believers"" as opposed to ""the non-believers"" also makes the Bible verse seem to say that the Israelites are allowed to kill for the spread of their religion whenever they think that it is necessary, which is, once again, not the case. Please stop tampering with God's word and let the people read exactly what the Bible says. \n\nBy the way, I love I Samuel 15:3. It shows how God exacts justice upon those that rebel against him. It also shows that God never forgets an unforgiven offense and reinforces the truth that, though one may get by with sin, one cannot get away with it.",society_culture

In the last three hundred and fifty years, many have been reduced to less than one hundred who speak their original tongue and some have become extinct, with little or no record.\n\nTo keep a culture alive. Get it recorded. Visit those old Cajuns with a recorder.  Ask questions, get them to tell stories.  Keeps notes on your work.

"whats inri stand for on the cross?  IESVS NAZARENVS REX IVDAEORVM\n\nSince anyone who would actually see the paintings of the Crucifixion in the Middle Ages (inside a Church) would then already be familiar with the phrase (in Latin), the painters all apparently chose to simplify their paintings by only including the initials of the four Latin words, I N R I. The early Church had also apparently used that abbreviation.\n\nLuke 23:38 also mentions the sign on the Cross, and he mentions that the sign was written in three languages, Greek, Latin and Hebrew. Scholars then chose to follow the wording presented in John, as it is more complete by including the reference to Nazareth, and as it might be presenting the Latin version of the text on the Cross. In all three languages the first word was Jesus, but since Greek and Hebrew don't use the letter J, His Name was spelled beginning with an I. The Roman (Latin) spelling followed that, (IESVS) even though their language included a J. The second word represented Nazareth, or Nazarene, N. The third word represented king, which in Latin (REX) begins with an R. The fourth word represented Jews, (IVDAEORVM) again spelled beginning with an I. You can see that the INRI then says ""Jesus Nazareth King Jews"".",society_culture

"What are the advantages and dis advantages of Islamic concept of no distinction between religion and govt?  Religious or Secular approach?\n\nThe modern concept of government is either based on the principal of race or nationality or geographical identity.\n\nIn case of USA the only uniting force is man made constitution which is liable to be rejected by a section of masses.\n\nWhen religion is the base it has no fundamental dispute. In terms of psychology religion serves as Primitive Belief which is undisputed and common to all.\n\nI know that Islam permits fullest religious liberty for non-Muslims in the Islamic state. I believe that other religions must also be having this freedom.\n\nIn case of religion and government there is no distinction so no fundamental clash where as in other societies there must be clashes.\n\nGermany is one example of liberty from religion.\n\nSocialist USSR is another example of refusal to religion.\n\nIn some answers Iraq and Iran have been coded.

"To rat or not to rat? I seen someone take something that wasn't theirs. They seen me see them. Should I tell the police? Well, there are three solutions to this problem. The first solution would be if there were other witnesses to the theft besides you, then you and the other witnesses should all go to the police and tell them together, anonymously. The second option would be, if you knew this person who stole something, to talk this person into going and telling the police. It may be hard to see someone you know being taken to jail, but it would be the right thing. \n   The third option that you have would be to not tell the police and act like it never happened. Unfortunately, I've been in your position once, when exactly the same thing that happened to you happened to me. However, I knew the person. What I did was acted like it never happened. That was the worst mistake of my life. Every single day, I regret my decision to act like the theft never happened. Please don't do what I did. While it might be the easy way out; afterwards, you will regret it for the rest of your life. \n     Don't listen to those answerers who tell you that if you tell the police, then you're a tattle-tale, because they're wrong. Reporting a crime to the police is not tattling.\n   If the person who stole something threatened your life after he/she saw you see him/her steal something, (and there were other witnesses), then you and those witnesses (if they were your friends) should go to the police station and explain your situation. You can do this completely anonymously. \n   However, if you were the only witness to the crime, don't worry. If this person stole something from a big store, then it's highly likely that one of the store's security cameras could have recorded the whole thing. \n    Tell the police everything. Don't do what I did. Don't take the easy way out of this situation. Believe me, you will regret it for the rest of your life. I already regret not telling the police. I don't know you and you don't know me, but please believe what I am telling you. If I could do that day over again, I would have reported that person that I saw steal something to the police. Whatever you do, don't make the same mistake I did and not tell the police.",society_culture

"Japanese business delegation and exchange of gifts? I have a Japanese delegation visiting my work soon. I just know that they will buy us all a small gift, as is customary in their culture. I work for a government organisation and we are not allowed to waste taxpayers' money on gifts for visiting delegations. Whenever we have Japanese visitors we always feel embarrassed at having nothing to offer in return.\n\nMy question falls into two parts:\n\n1) Do they expect a gift in return? After all, we are the hosting organisation and they are thanking us for our hospitality. Do they expect us to reciprocate, eg as thanks for their interest?\n\n2) If it is usual to expect a gift in return, I would like to make one out of my own pocket. What would be a suitable gift for a Japanese visitor to the UK? There would be about 8-10 people in the delegation and obviously I would like to be respectful while keeping costs down! Gifts\nGift giving is very important both business and personal situations \nStyle is everything. The gift itself is of little importance, the ceremony surrounding it is what matters. \nAlways wrap gifts. And choose the paper carefully, don’t give anything wrapped in white as it symbolizes death. Don’t use bright colours or bows to wrap the gift either. It is better to have the place you bought the gift to warp it to ensure that it is appropriate. \nGive your host some warning during the evening that you intend to give them a present. Don’t surprise your host. \nGive the gift with both hands and accept gifts with both hands. \nGenerally, gifts will not be opened while you are there. If your host insist that you open the gift they have given you, do so carefully. They take pride in gift wrapping, show that you appreciate the effort. \nDo not give gifts in odd numbers or the number four, odd numbers are bad luck and four sounds like the word for death in Japanese. \nGifts should be given at the end of a visit. \nDo not admire anything belonging to your host too closely. The Japanese love to please so you may end up taking it home as a gift. \nGood gift ideas are top choice beef, fruit and alcohol such as brandy, quality whiskey and wine \n\nGestures\nAvoid using large hand gestures, unusual facial expressions and any dramatic movements. The Japanese do not talk with their hands and to do so could distract your host. \nThe ""OK"" sign; in Japan it means money. Avoid using it \nDon’t point …or blow your nose in public \nDon’t crowd people or stand too close. Because the Japanese live in such a densely populated area, they value their personal space. \nA smile can have double meaning. It can express either joy or displeasure. Use caution with your facial expressions. They can be easily misunderstood. \n\n\nWhen meeting anyone in a business environment for the first time, it is customary to exchange ""meishi"" (business cards). You  should always present yours to the receiver using both hands to hold onto the corners as you pass it forward, stating your name and company as you do so. On receiving a person's meishi, accept it with both hands and then study carefully what is written on it. Very often business cards will have Japanese on one side and English on the reverse, so you should be able to understand what is written. If you are in a formal situation, it is proper to place the meishi face up on the table in front of you and refer to it as necessary. If it is in a less formal setting you may put the meishi away after looking at it, but please ensure to put it somewhere suitable. Just dropping it into a pocket maybe seen as rude.\n\nWhen visiting the office of a business associate, you will probably be shown into a meeting room and asked to wait. Most meeting rooms will consist of four or more chairs set around a table. As the honored guest it is important that you take the seat furthest from the door (although that maybe modified if it is a big conference style room) and you should stand up and bow or shakes hands when someone comes in the room. When receiving guests you would reverse the process, with you sitting on the side closest to the door, with the senior member of your party furthest from the door on your side. This ""furthest from the door"" approach also applies in most other situations, including restaurants, bars, taxis etc etc.\n\nWithin your own office life can be somewhat more relaxed although a certain amount of ceremony, involving lots of bowing and scurrying around, will be observed when senior managers are present. Generally though a nod of recognition is fine for those you work with, perhaps together with a comment on the weather or a similar subject. On arriving at your office in the morning a loudly spoken ""ohaiyo gozaimasu"" or ""Good morning"" should suffice with an equally loud ""osaki ni shitsure shimasu"" (literally ""excuse my rudene",society_culture

"L'escalade in Geneva? Does anybody know when is the exact date they celebrate the ""L'escalade"". When the festival and the parties will be held? Some said the 2nd Dec, some said the 12th Dec. I am so confused..... L'Escalade, or Fête de l'Escalade (from escalade, the act of scaling defensive walls) is an annual festival held in December in Geneva, Switzerland, celebrating the defeat of the surprise attack by troops sent by Charles Emmanuel I, Duke of Savoy during the night of 11–12 December 1602.\n\nAlthough the armed conflict actually took place after midnight, in the early morning on December 12, celebrations and other commemorative activities are usually held on December 11 or the closest weekend. Celebrations include a large marmite (cauldron) made of chocolate filled with marzipan vegetables and candies wrapped in the Geneva colors of red and gold. It's customary for the eldest and youngest in the room to smash the marmite, while reciting, ""Ainsi périssent les ennemis de la République! "" (Thus perish the enemies of the Republic). Other traditions include mulled wine, a large serving of soup, and children dressing up and singing for money. There is also a parade on Sunday evening. The names of the eighteen who died—Jacques Billon finally died of his wounds a year later—are called out, one after another. Since 1978 there has been another element to the celebration of the Escalade, with a road running event being held the weekend preceding the night of the 11th. The run traditionally starts in the parc des Bastions and goes through the Old City of Geneva, before finishing near the start again. It is one of the most significant annual events in Geneva, and is one of the most prestigious sporting events in Switzerland.",society_culture

As dusk grew close Polyphemus returned, again rolling back the boulder and letting in his flock. He then caught two more Greeks, killed them and ate them raw. After consuming both men he spoke to Odysseus asking, ""what is your name"", Odysseus' reply was ""Outis"" (in Greek this means ""nobody""). As part of the plan, Odysseus offered Polyphemus a full goatskin of wine and when he had finish the last drop, and feeling a little drunk, Polyphemus fell fast asleep. This was the time to take action, Odysseus and four of his men brought out the pole, which they had sharpened, and with one great thrust plunged the point into Polyphemus' eye, pushing it deep, to ensure it made him totally blind. The agonizing pain made Polyphemus scream out, so loud in fact that it brought the neighboring Cyclopes to see what was wrong.

"freemasons? does any one know who the free masons are and what do you think of them A fraternal order revived in the early 18th century in England, loosely based on associations or guilds of stone cutters (""operative"" masons). Freemasonry (""speculative"" masons) sought to give philosophical, moral, or spiritual meaning to the lodge, tools, and oaths of the stone cutters. Branches of Freemasonry include the Blue Lodge, York Rite, Scottish Rite, and Shriners. Affiliated organizations include the Order of the Eastern Star (for women), the Order of DeMolay (for boys), and the Order of Rainbow (for girls). Most modern adherents maintain that the organization is not a religion but a club or fraternity promoting high moral values and good works. They believe, therefore, that Freemasonry is compatible with and supplements Christianity and other religions. Critics counter that Freemasonry involves secret blood oaths or curses, and that the writings of respected early leaders (Albert Mackey, Albert Pike, etc.) are replete with occult philosophy and religious doctrine contrary to Christianity. Despite Freemasonry's promotion and funding of a number of worthwhile, philanthropic endeavors (free Shriner children hospitals, nursing homes, etc.), many Christian individuals and churches have condemned Freemasonry or warned of elements that they believe are contrary to Christianity. These churches include the Presbyterian Church of America, Southern Baptist Convention, Episcopal Church, Christian Reformed Church, Church of the Nazarene, and Lutheran Church (Missouri and Wisconsin Synods).",society_culture

"Should I Buy A Brat A Christmas Gift? I have a dear friend of the family (I'll call her Deborah) who does everything that she can to help my relatives and I with my                3 year-old little sister.  She baby-sits willingly, buys gifts for my sister during birthdays and holidays and often calls to see about our well-being.  The problem is that Deborah has the most obnoxious, spoiled, and ill-mannered 7 year-old grand daughter (Tara) who cannot differentiate adults from her peers.  Quite often I have put Tara in check for speaking rudely to adults and my sister and even hitting her.  And I've stopped myself from disciplining her on a few occasions because it's not my place.  So because Deborah has given so much to my sister should I feel obligated to purchase her little brat a gift as well this year?\n\nP.S. \nI will definitely buy Deborah a Christmas gift but that grand daughter, arrrgh!

"who is Babylon the great as mentioned in Rev. chpt. 17?  Babylon the Great is the world empire of false religion, embracing all religions whose teachings and practices do not conform to the true worship of Jehovah, the only true God. Following the Flood of Noah’s day, false religion had its beginning at Babel (later known as Babylon).  (Gen. 10:8-10; 11:4-9) In time, Babylonish religious beliefs and practices spread to many lands.  So Babylon the Great became a fitting name for false religion as a whole.\nWhat evidence points to the identity of Babylon the Great, referred to in Revelation?\n\nIt could not be the ancient city of Babylon.  Revelation was written at the end of the first century C.E. and describes events that would reach down to our day.  The Encyclopedia Americana says:  “The city Babylon was taken by the Persians under Cyrus the Great in 539 B.C. Later Alexander the Great planned to make Babylon the capital of his eastern empire, but after his death Babylon gradually lost importance.”  (1956, Vol. III, p. 7)  Today the city is an uninhabited ruin.\n\nIn the symbolism of Revelation, Babylon the Great is referred to as a “great city,” a “kingdom” that rules other kings.  (Revelation 17:18.)  Like a city, it would have many organizations within it; and like a kingdom that includes other kings in its domain, it would be international in scope.  It is described as having relations with political rulers and contributing much to the wealth of men in commerce, while itself being a third element that “has become a dwelling place of demons” and a persecutor of “prophets and of holy ones.”—Revelation 18:2, 9-17, 24.  \n\nAn empire can be political, commercial, or religious.  The woman named Babylon the Great is not a political empire because God’s Word states that “the kings of the earth,” or the political elements of this world, “committed fornication” with her.  Her fornication refers to the alliances she has made with the rulers of this earth and explains why she is called “the great harlot.”—Revelation 17:1, 2; James 4:4.\n\nBabylon the Great cannot be a commercial empire because the “merchants of the earth,” representing the commercial elements, will be mourning her at the time of her destruction. In fact, both kings and merchants are described as looking at Babylon the Great from “a distance.”  (Revelation 18:3, 9, 10, 15-17)  Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that Babylon the Great is, not a political or a commercial empire, but a religious one.\n\nThe religious identity of Babylon the Great is further confirmed by the statement that she misleads all the nations by means of her “spiritistic practice.”  (Revelation 18:23.)  Since all forms of spiritism are demon-inspired, it is not surprising that the Bible calls Babylon the Great “a dwelling place of demons.” (Revelation 18:2; Deuteronomy 18:10-12)  This empire is also described as being actively opposed to true religion, persecuting “prophets” and “holy ones.”  (Revelation 18:24) In fact, Babylon the Great has such deep hatred for true religion that she violently persecutes and even murders “the witnesses of Jesus.” (Revelation 17:6.) Hence, this woman named Babylon the Great clearly represents the world empire of false religion, which includes all religions that stand in opposition to Jehovah God.\n\nIf you would like further information or a free home Bible study, please contact Jehovah's Witnesses at the local Kingdom Hall.

"What is a Satanist?  The term ""Devil worship"" has a wide variety of associated meanings, but in its most objective sense, it simply refers to a religious belief in and worship of a Devil or devils. Devil worship can also be referred to as Diabolatry (from the Greek ""diabolos"" - devil - and ""latreia"" - worship), or as theistic Satanism. It is a controversial term, since ""Satanist"" carries a completely different meaning to those actually familiar or following with its practices and principles, who consider themselves maligned through ignorance. The term ""Devil worshiper"" has been used instead by LaVeyan Satanists as a term for those criminals who commit crimes citing Satan or Satanism as part of their justification.\n\nHowever, despite this, there is widespread assumption that Devil Worshipers and Satanists and criminals conducting abhorrent acts under the name of either of these terms, are the same. reasons why this is so include: (1) For many people (even Satanists), the terms ""Devil worshiper"" and ""Satanist"" are synonymous; (2) The media continues to use the term ""Satanist"" instead of ""Devil worshiper"" for criminals who commit crimes in the name of Satan (most likely because ""Satanist"" is shorter and fits more easily in a headline), (3) Many criminals who commit crimes in the name of Satan call themselves ""Satanists,"" not ""Devil worshipers,"" and (4) Referring to Satanism and Devil worship as ""completely separate concepts"" is often interpreted by non-Satanists as semantic gerrymandering and ""hair-splitting"" at best, or outright lying and deception at worst.\n\nOther common arguments includes that throughout history, there have been far more many crimes committed in the name of Jehovah, Jesus Christ and Allah than there have been in the name of Satan; yet people do not typically use the term ""Christ worship"" to be synonymous for criminal activity. Therefore, it makes even less sense to use the term ""Devil worship"" as a label for criminals, and the idea of claiming that someone is a criminal simply because they worship a particular deity or principle is difficult to accept.\n\nPart of the reason why many Satanists demonize the term ""Devil worshiper"" is because of the LaVeyan teaching that worshiping a deity is a sign of intellectual weakness. It is also commonly claimed that anyone who worships the Devil is necessarily constrained by Christian theology and dogma, whereas Satanism is ""freed"" from such. In fact most forms of contemporary Devil worship tend to divorce themselves from strict Christian theology in any event. The Joy of Satan is a good example of Devil worshipers who identify their idea of Satan with Sumerian mythology rather than the Bible, and the Church of Azazel practices a polytheistic form of Devil worship that combines elements of Deism and the African-based Diaspora religions (e.g., Vodou, Santeria, Umbanda) and emphasizes the importance of philosophy and intellectualism to its adherents.\n\nOn his website (""Your Friendly Neighborhood Devil Worshiper""), Geifodd ap Pwyll, a self-described Devil worshiper, defines Devil worship as ""the expression of ardent love, devotion, and reverence toward a cultural scapegoat figure, and the reclamation of said figure as a slandered divinity."" There is nothing in this definition which necessitates either criminal activity or a strict adherence to Christian theology. Devil worshipers can be monotheist, duotheist, polytheist, or even pantheist. There are various different ideas of just who and what Satan is among Devil worshipers, as well.",society_culture

"What does the ressurection mean for mankind?  Who Will Be Resurrected? Where Will They Live? \n\nHow many will live in Paradise on earth?— The Bible does not say. But God had told Adam and Eve while they were in the garden of Eden to have children and fill the earth. True, they failed to do that. But God will see to it that his purpose to have the earth filled with good people is carried out.—Genesis 1:28; Isaiah 45:18; 55:11.\n\nJust think how wonderful it will be to live in Paradise! The whole earth will become like a park. It will be alive with birds and animals and beautiful with trees and flowers of every kind. No one will have pain because he is sick, nor will anyone have to die. Everyone will be a friend of everyone else. If we want to live forever in Paradise, now is the time to prepare for it.\n\nIn the new world, “there is going to be a resurrection of both the righteous and the unrighteous.” (Acts 24:15) At that time Jesus will use his God-given power to raise the dead because, as he said, “I am the resurrection and the life. He that exercises faith in me, even though he dies, will come to life.” (John 11:25) He also said: “All those in the memorial tombs [in God’s memory] will hear his [Jesus’] voice and come out.”—John 5:28, 29.\n\n Great will be the joy earth wide when group after group of dead persons come back to life to join their loved ones! No longer will there be obituary columns to bring sadness to the survivors. Instead, there may well be just the opposite: announcements of newly resurrected ones to bring joy to those who loved them. So no more funerals, funeral pyres, crematoriums, or cemeteries!\n\nTrue peace in all areas of life will be realized. Wars, promoters of wars, and the manufacturing of weapons will be things of the past. \n“they will not lift up sword, nation against nation, neither will they learn war anymore.”—Micah 4:3.\n\nMan and beast will also be at peace, as they were in Eden. (Genesis 1:28; 2:19) God says: “For them I shall certainly conclude a covenant in that day in connection with the wild beast of the field and with the flying creature of the heavens and the creeping thing of the ground, and . . . I will make them lie down in security.”—Hosea 2:18.\nNever again will the animals be a threat to man or to themselves. Even “the lion will eat straw just like the bull”!—Isaiah 11:6-9; 65:25.\n\nThe entire earth will be transformed into a paradise home for mankind. That is why Jesus could promise a man who believed in him: “You will be with me in Paradise.” The Bible says: “The wilderness and the waterless region will exult, and the desert plain will be joyful and blossom as the saffron. . . . For in the wilderness waters will have burst out, and torrents in the desert plain.”—Luke 23:43; Isaiah 35:1, 6.\n\nUnder God’s Kingdom, hunger will never again afflict millions. “There will come to be plenty of grain on the earth.\n\nNo more will there be poverty, homeless people, slums, or neighborhoods overrun with crime. “They will certainly build houses and have occupancy; and they will certainly plant vineyards and eat their fruitage. Isaiah 65:21, 22\n\n“The meek ones themselves will possess the earth, and they will indeed find their exquisite delight in the abundance of peace. . . . The righteous themselves will possess the earth, and they will reside forever upon it.”—Psalm 37:11, 29\n\nGod’s Kingdom rule will undo all the damage done to the human family for the past six thousand years. The joys at that time will far outweigh any suffering that people have experienced. Life will not be disturbed by any bad memories of previous suffering. The upbuilding thoughts and activities that will be the everyday life of people will gradually erase the painful memories.",society_culture

"What kind of magic is possible from amaranthus caudatus flower? The other name for this flower is ""Love-Lies-Bleeding"".

Magically, its used for protection, fidelity, longevity, and transformation of grief.

"what are the names of the leaders in world war 2? eg: Hitler,Churchill Adolf Hitler - Nazi dictator of Germany (1933-45), planned and started World War 2, committed suicide at the end of the war. \nGeneral Hideki Tojo - Prime minister of Japan (October 1941 - July 1944). With a long militarist tradition, Japan became extremely militarist and aggressive in the 1930s and was practically governed by military leaders. Tojo, an aggressive army General, became minister of war in July 1941 and prime minister in October 1941. After a short attempt to improve relations with the US failed, he ordered to go to war and attack Pearl Harbor in December 1941. He gradually took more ministerial roles, and in Feb. 1944 also made himself the commander in chief, like Adolf Hitler did. When he realized that Japan was going to lose the war he resigned. The military continued to control Japan until the end of World War 2, which came when the Emperor Hirohito which was until then passive, ordered to surrender in order to prevent further inevitable destruction of Japan. After the war Tojo was executed for his responsibility to Japan's war crimes. \nBenito Mussolini, was the prime minister of Italy (1922-1943). A former journalist, he went to politics and formed the Fascist party, whose ideology, Fascism, called for a one-party state, total obedience, patriotic nationalism, and aggressive militarism. The ideology and its implementation in Mussolini's Italy influenced Adolf Hitler's own ideology, Nazism, which was a combination of Fascism with extreme racism. Initially Mussolini led a right-wing coalition, but later Italy became a one party state. His treatment of unemployment made Mussolini popular, but the military aggression of Fascism led to its failure. Mussolini was eager to demonstrate the ""strength"" of his regime by invading weaker neighbors. In 1935 he invaded and occupied the peaceful Ethiopia from Italy's nearby colony in East Africa. In 1936, the two Fascist dictators, Hitler and Mussolini, signed an alliance. In 1939 he invaded and occupied his small neighbor Albania, and Mussolini then enhanced his alliance with Hitler to a full military alliance. Mussolini knew that his military was not very effective, but when the Germans defeated the French and British forces in mid 1940 he thought it was safe enough for him to attack Britain and the collapsing France too and declared war, and in October 1940 he also invaded Greece, and was repelled. Mussolini had a million soldiers in Libya, and he sent them to attack the small British force in Egypt. The Italian Navy and Air Force attacked British ports and shipping in the Mediterranean, from Gibraltar in the West to Haifa (Israel) in the East. Despite its numerical strength and the fact that British forces in the Mediterranean were greatly outnumbered and very stretched, the Italian military could not defeat them anywhere, and was severely beaten by the British, and simply had to call for the help of the much more capable Germans. Even with German help, the British forces only lost their positions in Greece and kept fighting fiercely from their island bases in Malta, Gibraltar, and in North Africa. Mussolini's Italy became a German puppet, and even sent troops to participate in Germany's invasion of Russia. Eventually, British and American forces eliminated the Italian and German forces in North Africa and followed in July 1943 with an invasion of Sicily in South Italy. It was clear that Italy was losing the war, so several days after the invasion Mussolini was replaced and arrested in a remote mountain castle. Hitler sent commandos to rescue his friend from captivity. In April 1945, when German defence in North Italy collapsed, Mussolini was captured by Italian partisans and executed . \nThe defenders\nWinston Churchill kept warning of the Nazi danger in pre-war years. He was elected prime minister of Great Britain after the total collapse of the appeasement policy of his predecessor Neville Chamberlain. Chamberlain failed to understa",society_culture

I understand where you're coming from, my mom is basically clueless to the teen styles/social classes. EMO is short for emotional. at an age of changing hormones and fighting to fit in, if ppl don't find a place in the social chain where they can fit in, then they often start to block out alot of the world around them and try to seek shelter inside their mind hoping somehow they'll find a friend. EMO kids usually wear kind of a mix of rocker/punk/goth clothing but not full strand to either one. like a typical emo kid would prolly have a black shirt sporting a heavy metal band or just skulls flames and stuff like that, dark colored jeans usually tight, wristbands to their elbows, spikey dyed hair, and other dark colored accessories. hope after you get through decoding all of my ramblings that this helps.",society_culture
"Why didn't God forgive Adam and Eve?  God did forgive Adam and Eve.  He is perfectly merciful, so He always forgives.  But, God is also perfectly just, and justice demands punishment for sins.  It's like when David had a man killed so he could marry the man's wife.  After he repented, God forgave him.  But, He still punished him by taking is son.\n\nIt's the same for everybody.  Every person must suffer punishment, whether in this life or in the next, for all of their sins.\n\nA good Christian would forgive the man who killed his child.  But, justice demands that the man go to prison for his crime.\n\nOne more example:\nWhen a child misbehaves, his parents always forgive him.  But, they must punish him to make restitution for the offense and to teach him.  God is our Father and He does no less for us.  It brings to mind the scripture verse, ""Blessed is the man whom God chastises"".\n\nI hope this helps you understand how forgiveness and justice work together.",society_culture

This is something I've wondered about for a long time.  To me it makes so much sense that everyones spiritual path is unique to them, that there is no such thing as a ""one True"" way.  Everyone sees a different face of the divine.... \n\nThe reasons why people are afraid are simple though - they are uncertain.   Any act of faith makes people feel vulnerable - it should!  Faith is an act of belief without any tangible proof, of course people can get touchy/defensive about it.  Faith makes people feel good, but any challenge to that (such as the existance of multiple religions) means that there may be something else that they haven't considered.

In order to understand that Scripture you have to read it in the context of the surrounding scriptures. These scriptures are addressing sexual morality.

We than are in right relationship with our heavenly Father, as it was meant to be from the beginning. When we make Jesus our Lord, He is with us always, that is why we should choose not to commit sin, especially sexual sin. It is like having sex in front of your parents!

"God has God? Christians have made the claim that Jesus has 2 natures. One man nature, which he took on, and one divine nature which he always had. They claim as a man, he ate, slept and died etc. \n\nThey also claim as a man it would be normal for Jesus to say I have a God. Such as in: \n\n\nJohn 20: 15-18: \n\n15 Jesus saith unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? whom seekest thou? She, supposing him to be the gardener, saith unto him, Sir, if thou have borne him hence, tell me where thou hast laid him, and I will take him away. 16 Jesus saith unto her, Mary. She turned herself, and saith unto him, Rabboni; which is to say, Master. 17 Jesus saith unto her, Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended to my Father: but go to my brethren, and say unto them, I ascend unto my Father, and your Father; and to my God, and your God. 18 Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples that she had seen the LORD, and that he had spoken these things unto her.\n\n\nChristians have come up with the weak response that this was the man nature of Jesus speaking. For argument sake we will take this response as correct. So we are able to conclude that: \n\n1-     Jesus has 2 natures, one divine one human\n\n2-     The man nature eats, sleeps, prays and has a God \n\n3-     The divine nature does not sleep, pray, or has a God \n\n\nHowever so, it may come as a surprise to many people, but however so the supposed divine Jesus also said he has a God! \n\n\nRevelations 3:12: \n\n12 Him that overcometh will I make a pillar in the temple of my God, and he shall go no more out: and I will write upon him the name of my God, and the name of the city of my God, which is new Jerusalem, which cometh down out of heaven from my God: and I will write upon him my new name.\n\n\nSo as you can see, the divine Jesus still says he has a God! This is not Jesus as man speaking anymore, but this is Jesus as divine speaking, so how can the divine Jesus say I have a God? This clearly proves that there is no such thing as a divine Jesus, and that Jesus is not God since he has a God, even when he is in his supposed divine state. \n\nSo I would really love to see a response from the Christians on this. Why does the divine Jesus say I have a God? Jesus the flesh was that of a man, God did not dwell in Jesus until Jesus was baptized. In Jesus, God pour out his spirit without measure, Meaning all that God is, is now in Jesus, But don't mis-understand this point, Even though God dwell in Christ without measure does not mean that all of God now dwells in Only Jesus & nowhere else, God is everywhere. So that is the Divine side of Jesus. Jesus still has a father, why, Because Jesus with his Bride will rule & reign on this earth for 1000 yrs. that is called the millennium, & after the Millennium Christ comes off his throne in the temple, & after the Great white Throne Judgement, this earth had also been redeemed back to God the Father, The one eternal spirit. Therefore Jesus will not be the redeemer after that, because even this earth is redeemed back to GOD, Then Jesus comes off the throne & becomes our elder brother, & then God will sit on that throne forever world without end & the eternal age.",society_culture

This is one of the reasons that man has taught a hell fire doctrine.  Which is not true by the way.  Jesus is talking about non believers and what might happen to them.  Not that it will.

How do you read ""Quintus"" in vulgar latin! I know in latin it's: ""cvintus"" Vulgar Latin is just your everyday, common, or slang usage.  While the term is primarily applied to the Latin that was spoken in the Middle Ages, it has been around since the beginning of the empire - the playwright Plautus (about 280 BC) is considered to have written in vulgar Latin.  It similar to the difference between saying ""equestrian"" and ""rider"".  By the time the Middle Ages came around, the slang usages had replaced the regular ones (caballus in place of equus, bellus instead of pulcher).  Which is why the Romance languages have variants of these later Latin words, as opposed to the classical ones.\n\nThe pronunciation did change; during the classical period, the c was hard like a k, but it softened to a ch or s sound a few centuries later.  As with the ae and oe ligatures - the a and o portions were dropped as the pronunciation changed.

"what is the differece between language and dialect?  I'm a linguist, so I will give you the definition that linguists use.  By definition, two forms of communication are dialects of the same language if they are mutually intelligible.  That means, if two people who are speaking different forms can understand each other, they are speaking two dialects of the same language.  Likewise, if two people cannot understand each other, they are speaking different languages.\n\nIt turns out in practice that this definition is affected by sociopolitical factors.  For example, the different forms of communication used in China are often called ""dialects"" of Chinese, even though they are not mutually intelligible, for political reasons.  The Chinese government wants to make it seem like their people are more linguistically unified.  On the other hand, speakers of Norwegian and Danish can understand each other very easily, but they call their dialects by different names because they want to point out that they live in different countries.\n\nAlso, the mutual intelligibility definition is not completely easy to work out, because there are varying degrees of mutual intelligibility between certain dialects of languages.  For example, I am a speaker of American English, and I therefore have the same native language as speakers of Irish English.  However, I haven't been exposed to much Irish English, so sometimes I find it difficult to understand.  I find British English easier to understand because I've been exposed to it on television, for example.\n\nNevertheless, mutual intelligibility is the factor that people use to distinguish dialect from language.  Linguists also get around these difficulties by using the term ""variety"", which can work for either a dialect or a language.\n\nADDITIONAL: The definition that the previous person gave you is actually better as a discussion of standard vs. nonstandard dialect, rather than language vs. dialect.  In many countries, dialects that don't have high status are called ""dialect"", while dialects that have high status are called ""languages"".  That's another example of how sociopolitical factors can affect this discussion.",society_culture

"Why do people continue to argue about evolution.? Nobody is saying that God is or isn't real, their just saying that evolution is real.  Why is it real and what sparks it? that's the philisophical part, but it is scientific fact that humans (homo sapiens) evolved from a less sophisticated specias of non humans (Homo erectus) which evolved from a species less sophisticated than that (homo habilas) all the way down to simple primates.  If this were untrue, than fossils and carbon dating are untrue, in which case dinosaurs are made up as well. If evolution is untrue, then there is no such thing as knowledge. If evolution is not true then there is no difference between knowledge and belief. If evolution is not true, then we have no possibility of ever understanding anything about ourselves or the universe (or if there is a universe), including the alleged existence of mythical supreme beings.\n\nWithout the scientific theory of evolution, every life science, including modern medicine, collapses. To be true to their faith, all those who reject evolution should also refuse modern medical care since (without the theory of biological evolution to explain and justify it) it is no different than Voodoo and Witch doctoring.\n\n-----------------------------------------\nOdindmar -\n\nNo, it is about right and wrong.

"What language is spoken in Bulgaria?  dont worry, you will hear it  soon enough!",society_culture
"why cant you pronounce ""kh"" and ""gh"" in english? like pronouncing irak instead of iragh\nalthough its ""argh"" infact. For the same reason that many non-English speakers can't pronounce English ""r"" or short ""a"" sounds.  When a baby starts to talk (babbling), they make every possible speech sound.  As they grow, their babbling changes to include only sounds in the language(s) that they hear around them.\n\nIn fact, adults usually can't even *hear* sounds that aren't in their repertoire.  For instance, the German city of ""Muenchen"" has an ""oo"" sound in the first syllable in English and an ""ee"" sound in some other languages.  The actual sound in German is about halfway between the two (start saying ""oo"", hold your lips still and move your tongue as if you were going to say ""ee"").  People from different linguistic backgrounds *heard* and interpreted the sound in different ways.\n\nWhen a child starts talking, she/he learns further how to use these sounds and put them together.  Until about age 10 to 12, a child can learn a new language perfectly.  After that time, it is virtually impossible for most people.  And one of the *hardest* things to learn is new speech sounds.",society_culture

"Is there really anything like God,or its only a weakness of mind?  It is not so much a weakness of mind as it is a lie that has been perpetrated on the people of the world.\n\nthe most important thing to know/understand is that the Christian religeon arose approximately 150 years after Jesus' death, by a group of politicians who wished to gain more power over the people. The Bible originally contained over 300 gospels, but Constantine the emperor (just after coverting to Christianity because he saw the decline of his kingdom as emminant) burned the books that did not agree with what he wanted taught to the masses. Organized religeon is a sham. \n\nHowever, spirituality definitly exists, as there must be some form and reason to our existence. But that reason is not to worship a God and live in fear of going to hell for not doing what that church teaches. It often makes me irate that our government calls the enemies of America religeous zealots - the truth is, our own government is run by religeous zealots, zealots of the Christian right. There is no room in the world for anyone who doesnt believe what our government leaders believe. \n\nI believe is gnoticism, the search for knowledge and truth. Is there any possible relationship to the fact that every ancient culture on earth believed in the feathered serpent God of knowledge, yet Christianity demonified the snake in the story of Adam and Eve? the Gnostics taught that the snake in the tree was actually attempting to save mankind, informing Eve that God forbid you from eating from the tree of knowledge BECAUSE HE DID NOT WANT HIS CREATION TO BECOME HIS EQUAL.

There are many Americans of all ages living in Ireland and most of them are able to integrate very well into Irish life.

Another point is that the country has gone through a lot of changes in the last few years, so it's probably a lot more possible nowadays to integrate without people wanting or needing to know your business.

"Can anyone recommend a good meditation tape or machine? Where has it taken you? if u r looking for a way to relax and releave stress, it's best u do it naturally. i would recommend u against using machines, tapes, pills, or any other artificial means.\n\ninstead, why don't u try yoga, meditation in a park (or any other form of nature close to u...the more ""natural"" it is, the better!), light strolls on sunny days or even enjoying a good sunset either alone or with company (be sure not to have very TALKATIVE company in that case)? of course, rectifying ur breathing method can also do wonders in meditation. the average Hindu monk breathes inhales and exhales after 15 or so seconds. then he exhales and takes another 10 seconds before taking another breath. as weird of impossible as that may sound to some people, it works wonders not only for ur phychological state, but also helps speed up ur metabolism and perfect ur bodily functions (like digestion and such). \n\nMonks believe that people are born with a specific amount of breathes. according to their beliefs, our life comes to an end once we use up our last breath. so the longer the pause between each breath, the less breaths one will take in total at the end of the day, leaving them with a bigger number of days to live in the long run.\n\nu don't have to believe this theory about breaths, but seriously, breathing slowly CAN help u be calmer! but it might take a while to get used to the change if u r used to breathing short and shallow.\n\nthis is another case where ""practise makes perfect"". so i wish u the best of luck and happy meditating!",society_culture

"what is the connection between postmodernism and transsexual issue? pls comment about it “Language is part of the dialectic of sexuality,” says Derrida; however, according to Long, it is not so much language that is part of the dialectic of sexuality, but rather the absurdity of language. The characteristic theme of Pickett’s analysis of Marxist socialism is the paradigm, and some would say the genre, of neodialectic sexual identity. However, Sartre uses the term ‘dialectic Marxism’ to denote a mythopoetical whole.\n\nIf one examines Marxist socialism, one is faced with a choice: either reject dialectic Marxism or conclude that the law is meaningless. Baudrillard promotes the use of material rationalism to challenge and read class. Thus, the subject is interpolated into a dialectic Marxism that includes art as a totality.\n\n“Sexuality is intrinsically elitist,” says Debord. Several discourses concerning the difference between sexual identity and society may be discovered. However, the subject is contextualised into a Marxist socialism that includes narrativity as a reality.\n\nThe main theme of the works of Stone is the economy of predeconstructivist sexuality. Any number of narratives concerning the precapitalist paradigm of expression exist. In a sense, Derrida suggests the use of dialectic Marxism to attack class divisions.\n\nMany desublimations concerning the role of the participant as reader may be revealed. Thus, Foucault’s essay on the precapitalist paradigm of expression suggests that art is used to marginalize the underprivileged.\n\nBaudrillard uses the term ‘Marxist socialism’ to denote the bridge between class and reality. Therefore, the premise of dialectic Marxism implies that class has significance.\n\nAn abundance of narratives concerning Marxist socialism exist. It could be said that de Selby states that we have to choose between dialectic Marxism and Derridaist reading.\n\nLyotard promotes the use of Marxist socialism to challenge society. However, Baudrillard uses the term ‘dialectic semioticism’ to denote the role of the writer as reader.\n\nThe subject is interpolated into a Marxist socialism that includes narrativity as a paradox. Thus, Sontag uses the term ‘the precapitalist paradigm of expression’ to denote the rubicon, and some would say the collapse, of postcapitalist class.\n\nThe subject is contextualised into a modern paradigm of expression that includes language as a whole. However, Bataille’s model of dialectic Marxism implies that truth serves to reinforce archaic perceptions of narrativity, but only if language is distinct from truth; if that is not the case, we can assume that discourse is created by communication.",society_culture

If YOU loved me, YOU would rejoice that I am going my way to the Father, because the Father is greater than I am.\nAnd he also said that he went his way to the father. Does that sound like they are the same?\n1 Cor. 11:3 “I want you to understand that the head of every man is Christ, the head of a woman is her husband, and the head of Christ is God.” (Clearly, then, Christ is not God, and God is of superior rank to Christ. It should be noted that this was written about 55 C.E., some 22 years after Jesus returned to heaven. So the truth here stated applies to the relationship between God and Christ in heaven.)\n\n\nWhat is the origin of the Trinity doctrine?\n\nThe New Encyclopædia Britannica says: “Neither the word Trinity, nor the explicit doctrine as such, appears in the New Testament, nor did Jesus and his followers intend to contradict the Shema in the Old Testament: ‘Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God is one Lord’ (Deut. 6:4). . . . The doctrine developed gradually over several centuries and through many controversies. . . . By the end of the 4th century . . . the doctrine of the Trinity took substantially the form it has maintained ever since.”—(1976), Micropædia, Vol. X, p. 126.\n\nThe New Catholic Encyclopedia states: “The formulation ‘one God in three Persons’ was not solidly established, certainly not fully assimilated into Christian life and its profession of faith, prior to the end of the 4th century. But it is precisely this formulation that has first claim to the title the Trinitarian dogma. Among the Apostolic Fathers, there had been nothing even remotely approaching such a mentality or perspective.”—(1967), Vol. XIV, p. 299.\n\nIn The Encyclopedia Americana we read: “Christianity derived from Judaism and Judaism was strictly Unitarian [believing that God is one person]. The road which led from Jerusalem to Nicea was scarcely a straight one. Fourth century Trinitarianism did not reflect accurately early Christian teaching regarding the nature of God; it was, on the contrary, a deviation from this teaching.”—(1956), Vol. XXVII, p. 294L.\n\n\nloj",society_culture

If your father was referring to British royalty and you are keen to trace your family in the UK, you will need to look at your family's birth, marriage and death certificates. If your Dad has his birth certificate it will show your grandparents' names. You can then trace back to their certificates and discover your great grandparents' names until they started in 1837. From that information, you should be able to discover dates and places and compare them to censuses which will give you more information. Finally, the oldest data around is contained in parish registers. It will take some doing to find out, but is possible.\n\nA lot of this information has been made available on-line.\n\nIf your ancestors were royal doctors, it is also likely that they will appear in history books and biographies - so it is worth rooting around your second hand bookshops and library too.\n\nThe BBC has a brilliant website that will help anyone interested in finding out about their British ancestory.

"Why are all the UK (& also US) Chatrooms full of Filipina girls? What exactly do they want from us? Whenever i go to a local UK/London chatroom on Yahoo Chat hoping to find a local girl to chat to, I invariably land up wid a Filipina girl. You don't even have to msg them, as they come and try to chat to you by yourself.  Couple of them also offered me to strip on their cam in return for some money. Out of curiousity, I even tried some US chatrooms and found Filipinas there too!\n\nI wonder why don't they go and chat up in some Phillipines chatroom. What exactly are all of them looking for in UK/US chatrooms? Are they looking up for some guys who would give em a UK/US Visa? Or to rip-off someone in exchange for their nude show on webcam? Some, but not all mind you, are probably looking to find someone to either marry them or be their 'financial sponsor', i.e. their ""Sugar Daddy"". \nI used to work with a Filipino gentleman, and, according to what he told me once while we were talking on a break at work, a hundred US dollars, or the same amount in British pounds, is enough for a family of three or four to live on for almost a month in the Phillipines, and ten or twenty thousand dollars could buy the next best thing to a mansion outright. \nDon't fall for any lines they may give you, like one or both of their parents being ill and not having enough money to pay for medical care or being in college and suddenly losing their 'scholarship' or 'grant'.\nI also mentioned some girls from his home country had to my former co-worker and he informed me that the ones who 'offer to strip' are basically the kind of girls you NEVER want to give any personal information to, because they're either scamming you on their own or working for someone else running the scam, usually someone with better computer skills than the average person on the internet, meaning a hacker or even group of hackers.\nLike I said in my first line, not all of the girls are like that though, some genuinely want to find a foreign spouse, since even someone who makes less than $25,000, or the equivalent in British pounds, is considered to have a mid to upper middle class income in relation to the the average income in the Phillipines, and other countries as well.\nSo, try to avoid the ones who 'offer' to do anything at all in return for money, and block them from contacting you if at all possible, but if one of them merely wants to talk with someone who lives in a different country, and there are some of them out there, feel free to chat with them, but if money ever comes up in the conversation, meaning she suddenly needs some, within the first month, it's probably a long term scam.\nAlso, I'm sorry to say, the Filipina women aren't the only ones doing this sort of thing, I've seen numerous women from the former USSR, and even a few from Southeast Aisa, Taiwan, Thailand, Viet Nam, and Korea (North and South), doing the same thing.\nOne Russian woman even contacted me out of the blue and told me she had seen my picture and knew from merely looking at it that she and I were 'soulmates', then tried to persuade me to pay for her visa fees and airline ticket to come to the US--as if I could afford that sort of thing on what I was making at the time. (If I could have afforded to let her have the amount of money she was asking me for I wouldn't have been driving a thirdhand Dodge Dakota with over 200,000 miles on the odometer at the time.)\nJust try to ignore the more blatant ones out there, or if you can report them for abusing the chat room privileges, if they have and usually 'offering to strip' for money falls into the category of abuse because they're basically using the chat room to line up clients for their business, namely the porn or scam business.\nI apologize if my statements offend anyone, but I am merely passing on my own experience and information I have received in a firsthand conversation with a Native Filipino gentleman.\nI fully realize a lot of single women in other countries are merely looking for a foreign spouse who can give them a better life than they have in their own nation--this warning is not directed against those honest women, it is directed at the DISHONEST ones trying to get money from other people.",society_culture

"Where does the phrase ""The Whole 9 Yards come from"">?  I answered this question a few days back with this information:\n\n This phrase is of unknown origin and is the subject of some debate. At issue is to what does nine yards refer. The meaning is clearly the entirety or everything, but nine yards is not a significant measure of anything. All we know about its origin is that the phrase cannot be traced any earlier than the mid-1960s and that it is American in origin.\n\nPerhaps the most common assumption is that it is from American football, but the canonical distance in that game is ten, not nine, yards. Also common are explanations based on length of cloth, but there is no standard length for a bolt of cloth (which measure anywhere from twenty to twenty-five yards), and nine yards is not a significant measure for any type of garment (a man's suit uses about seven yards of a thirty-inch bolt, double folded; sarongs, saris, kilts, kimonos, bridal veils and any number of other garments have been suggested, none with any accompanying evidence).\n\nThe explanation that is currently circulating around the internet most frequently is that nine yards was the length of a belt of machine gun ammunition carried by a WWII fighter plane. To ""give it the whole nine yards"" was to expend all of one's ammo. This explanation is almost certainly false. For one thing, the type of fighter varies with the teller, sometimes Spitfires in the Battle of Britain, sometimes varying American fighters in the South Pacific. Another reason to doubt it is that ammunition is either counted in rounds or by weight. It is never measured in length of a belt. Chapman points to an origin in the Army and Air Force, which fits in with the post-WWII-era origin, but is otherwise unexplained.",society_culture

"Who was the creator of Judaism, How? Why? Specific Person and Event if you know Abraham, Isaac and Jacob were the founders of the people and men of faith, but they never called their religion ""Judaism"".  In fact the word ""Judaism"" never appears in the Bible (not even in the Christian Bible).\n\nObviously in Judaism G-d is the Creator.  But I don't think that is quite what you are asking. \n\nJudaism is founded on Torah.  Torah is the 5 books of Moses - Genesis through Deuteronomy. So Moses is perhaps the personality that you are looking for.  \n\nThe story of the Exodus is often looked upon as being like a betrothal and marriage. The descendants of Jacob - the children of Israel - had become slaves in Egypt.  G-d sees this and like an angry boyfriend comes in, curses the Egyptians with 10 plagues, takes Israel out.  He leads them through the waters of the Red Sea and kills the enemies that are following them.  He then leads them to Mount Sinai where He gives them His Covenant. (Much as the marriage contract is read in a traditional wedding.) Read Exodus 1 through 20.\n\nIsrael entered into the Promised Land and generations later the nation was split into 2 kingdoms.  Israel was the northern kingdom and Judah was the southern kingdom.  Israel was conquered by Assyria and the people there were dispersed amoung the nations and no one knows where their descendants are now.  Judah was taken into captivity by Babylon but was allowed to return.  They were later conquered again by Greeks and then by the Romans.  \n\nSince the area was called Judea, the nation was called Judah, and the people were called Jews; the unnamed religion of the people became known as ""Judaism"".",society_culture

I was not very happy about this for 2 reasons, how ridiculus to make them and us stand out in the cold to do this, and 2 why isnt a traditional play being done, I telephoned the head mistress this morning, as many parents this morning, we not happy about this, and her reply was, well we live in a multi racial community and some of these children cannot participate in the nativitly plays!!  never mind that it is a Church of England school, the majority of children are of that religion, and because of a few people they wont do such thing. It is multi cultural week at school, they had to dress up in costumes from around the world, have visited a Jewish exhibtition, Neither Christmas nor Easter have any connection with Christianity. So-called ""Christmas"" celebrates the pagan Saturnalia and the appropriately-named ""Easter"" celebrates the pagan goddess Eostre.\n\nJesus was not even born in December. Nearly all so-called Christmas customs dishonor Christ.\n\nhttp://watchtower.org/e/19981215/article_02.htm\nhttp://watchtower.org/e/20001215/\nhttp://watchtower.org/e/20041215/article_01.htm\nhttp://watchtower.org/e/19981215/\nhttp://watchtower.org/e/rq/article_11.htm\n\nChristendom adopts ""Easter"" from pagan worship of the Anglo-Saxon goddess Eostre (or Oestre). Most Easter traditions merely repackage pagan fertility festivals and concentrate on eating, decorating, and frivolity. Christ certainly never wanted that.\n\nBy contrast, it's tragic that the one holiday Christ actually *DID* ask Christians to commemorate is entirely ignored by almost all of Christendom. It is, of course, the Memorial of Christ's death, sometimes called ""the Last Supper"" or ""the Lord's Evening Meal"".\n\n(1 Corinthians 11:23-25, NWT) The Lord Jesus in the night in which he was going to be handed over took a loaf... Keep doing this in remembrance of me.” 25 He did likewise respecting the cup.. Keep doing this... in remembrance of me.” \n\n(1 Cor 11:24, 25, NEB) ""Do this as a memorial of me.” \n\n\nChrist Jesus himself personally celebrated and explained the significance of that Last Supper to his followers (see Matthew 26:26-29). Christians who commemorate the Last Supper have done so on the same Jewish calendar date as Jesus did, Nisan 14, which generally falls between late March and mid-April. Interestingly, Christians in the centuries immediately after Christ's impalement were sometimes called ""Quartodecimans"" which literally mean ""Fourteen-ers"", because the early Christians were well-known for this true holy day.\n\nHow would Jesus feel to learn that the holiday he commanded was widely ignored, while his so-called followers chose to celebrate a pagan false god and their own traditions of men? We don't need to wonder.\n\n(Matthew 15:6-9) You have made the word of God invalid because of your tradition. 7 You hypocrites, Isaiah aptly prophesied about you when he said, 8 ‘This people honors me with their lips, yet their heart is far removed from me. 9 It is in vain that they keep worshiping me, because they teach commands of men as doctrines.’”\n\nLearn more:\nhttp://watchtower.org/e/lmn/article_08.htm\nhttp://watchtower.org/e/rq/article_11.htm\nhttp://watchtower.org/e/20041215/article_02.htm\nhttp://watchtower.org/e/20011115/article_02.htm\nhttp://watchtower.org/e/20050101a/\nhttp://watchtower.org/e/jt/",society_culture

"wat happens after death?  Death is not the end. Death is really a beginning—another step forward in Heavenly Father’s plan for His children. \nSomeday, like everyone else, your life on Earth will end and your physical body will die. But your spirit will not die. At the time of physical death, your spirit will go to the spirit world, where you will continue to learn and progress. Our spirits will carry to the spirit world the same tendencies, appetites, and desires that we had when we lived on the earth. (Alma 34:34)\n\nDeath is a necessary step in your progression, just as your birth was. Sometime after your death, your spirit and your body will be reunited—never to be separated again. This is called resurrection. It is a gift to every person who ever lived, made possible by the death and Resurrection of Jesus Christ. Perhaps no statement in scripture more dramatically reveals a divine truth than Paul’s epistle to the Corinthians: “For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive.” (1 Corinthians 15:22.)\n\nPeople who have accepted the gospel of Jesus Christ and lived righteously are assigned to a state of happiness known as paradise. People who have rejected the gospel and people who have died without a knowledge of the truth are assigned to a state of darkness called spirit prison, sometimes called hell.\n\nAlma wrote: “Concerning the state of the soul between death and the resurrection—Behold, it has been made known unto me … that the spirits of all men, as soon as they are departed from this mortal body, … are taken home to that God who gave them life. …"" “ ‘Taken home to God,’ simply means that their mortal existence has come to an end, and they have returned to the world of spirits, where they are assigned to a place according to their works with the just or with the unjust, there to await the resurrection” (Answers to Gospel Questions, comp. Joseph Fielding Smith Jr., 5 vols. [1957–66], 2:85).\n\n“The spirits of those who are righteous are received into a state of happiness, which is called paradise, a state of rest, a state of peace, where they shall rest from all their troubles and from all care, and sorrow.”\n\n“And then shall it come to pass, that the spirits of the wicked … shall be cast out into outer darkness; … \n\n“… this is the state of the souls of the wicked, yea, in darkness, and a state of awful, fearful looking for the fiery indignation of the wrath of God upon them; thus they remain in this state, as well as the righteous in paradise, until the time of their resurrection.” (Alma 40:11–14.)\n\nDuring the three days after he was crucified, Jesus Christ visited the righteous in paradise. (1 Peter 3:18–20) Christ appointed messengers to preach to those in spirit prison. Until that time, the spirits in spirit prison were not permitted to have contact with the spirits in paradise. While righteous spirits await their resurrection, they are busy carrying on the work of our Heavenly Father.\n\n“Now that the righteous spirits in paradise have been commissioned to carry the message of salvation to the wicked spirits in hell, there is a certain amount of mingling together of the good and bad spirits. Repentance opens the prison doors to the spirits in hell; it enables those bound with the chains of hell to free themselves from darkness, unbelief, ignorance, and sin. As rapidly as they can overcome these obstacles—gain light, believe truth, acquire intelligence, cast off sin, and break the chains of hell—they can leave the hell that imprisons them and dwell with the righteous in the peace of paradise” (Elder Bruce R. McConkie, Mormon Doctrine, 2nd ed. [1966], 755).\n\nOur resurrection will not be an end but a new beginning. It will prepare us for judgment by the Lord, who said, “As I have been lifted up [upon the cross] by men even so should men be lifted up by the Father, to stand before me, to be judged of their works.” (3 Ne. 27:14.)

"Which is a better place to live in Chicago or New York and why? Can't decide where to move There is some bias since I am from Chicago, but having been in New York as well, I'd still have to ADVISE CHICAGO!!! \n\nBy compare to New York, Chicago is a friendlier place with midwest charm - yet w/a keep it real attitude, (good for business and friendships alike) much cleaner and although expensive NOT nearly as high in cost of living as New York City. Down to earth place with EVERYTHING to do that embraces ALL kinds. You kinda walk outside and run into something. There's always something happening. Even if you opt for a pool hall amongst strangers, you will have a good time. Transportation - the ""L"" and bus system gets you everywhere pretty much 24 hours a day (not in some of the hoods after midnight, tho). Traffic is rough, but you CAN move. NYC is nearly impossible. Not to mention they drive like they have a death wish. Aggressive, fast and even creative driving is important skill. But to drive like you can go through people like Casper is asking for heart failure. The lakefront!! And attached grass knolls and parks. It is far and wide, appears clean and simply beautiful. The view of the horizon is endless. The large rocks and piers in neighborhood beaches gives you the feeling that you personally own the place. The public art - statues, giant picasso piece, heck the bridges over the Rivers. Chinatown's entryway... The parks, boulevards are cleaned up and richer than ever. Re-Progress has hit this town in the best way. Where was once gang and drug infestation, they have taken it back. (orig to clean up to attract the Olympics, now major Investment Oppys and a reversal of the suburb escape back to the city. The architecture of the homes, buildings are world reknowned. Not just downtown, but in neighborhoods, suburbs. Culture - arts, main library/many neighborhood libraries, every religion and house of worship available, Chicago symphony, booth play houses throughout as well as big Broadway stuff, zoos, museums (oh the museums, not stuffy simplistics - w/free days too?!), music venues in old neighborhood theatres...it's endless. Getting around is an easy figure. The streets are made like a checker board grid - YOU CAN'T GET LOST. There may be 10 or so streets on angle, yet consistent. Unlike the separation and confusion of the burroughs and bridges and tolls (OH MY!) of NYC - to a newcomer, it's a nightmare. In NYC, one side doesn't know the other if you dare ask direction. Chicago is also a smart city with amazing schools (both private and some public). University of Chicago* Northwestern* DePaul* Loyola. Open minds. Music!? Please. KNOWN for Jazz, blues (see it live in Chicago if you hadn't experienced the love of this music), house and now hip-hop (Kanye, Common and well, Twista) Rock and acoustic is brilliant. I saw a cover band that done the group ""War"" and you close your eyes and damn, it WAS ""War"". Bands can sustain a living here because the city is a proud place that supports one another on many artistic and business fronts. For instance, you can't get real carmel/cheese popcorn anywhere else but Chicago. Incredible, GREAT FOOD THATS AFFORDABLE. PIZZA?? Whew. We won't go there. The food standard is high. So it's hard to get bad food. It's proud for cooking good food, no matter the location, appearance or price of the joint. Diverse is a given. Not becuase all types of people/races both rich and poor just live there (that's many places these days), but all can live amongst each other fairly harmoniously (mainly on the North and Northwest sides) with exceptance and fair treatment. It's nothing new to Chicago. They don't have to get used to each other, It's an OLD city that opened their arms to immigrants in the 1800s just as New Yorks' Ellis Island did. It's a proud place to be a person of color. With the black political history in all it's glum and gorly - a lot has been taught, learned and respected regardles",society_culture

"Scientology  is about  What exactly? I believe  organized religion helps people cope with things like loss, grief,etc. But scientology seems to shun all that. I tried to go to the website to read on it and had to answer a whole lot of questions and I quickly got bored. I heard stuff about aliens and the like. Is that true? How can a novelist start a religion. I was young and I remember a lady climbing a hill and they were talking about the book ""Diuretix"" I think, by L Ron Hubbard. And the episode of S Park was funny but answered no questions. Please assist. Actually, you'd be surprised at how accurate that South Park episode was.  Whenever they had ""THIS IS WHAT SCIENTOLOGISTS ACTUALLY BELIEVE"" on the screen, they were NOT kidding.  Yes, the bit about aliens is true.  And yes, it's true, L. Ron Hubbard, the science fiction writer, created a ""religion"".  Here, I'll explain what it's all about.\n\nIt is a CULT. Despite what a few fanatical members may say, it IS a cult. The church harasses & bullies anyone who they deem an ""enemy"" (basically anyone who has anything negative to say about the ""church""). They will RUIN YOUR LIFE if you speak out against them long enough.\n\nThe founder is L. Ron Hubbard, the science FICTION writer who once told a friend that the best way to make lots of money is to start your own religion. Though being a very outspoken critic of psychiatric drugs, it was discovered upon Hubbards death that the anti-anxiety drug hydroxyzine (Vistaril) was present in his body, which several of his assistants would later attest was only one of many psychiatric & pain medications Hubbard ingested over the years. (visit this link to read about the uses of hydoxyzine: http://www.drugs.com/mtm/v/vistaril.html )\n\nScientologists believe the evil alien ruler Xenu killed a lot of aliens (Thetans) from around the universe by bringing them to earth & blowing them up inside volcanoes. They believe the souls of these aliens (these souls are ""Body Thetans"") have attached themselves to us & cause many of our mental & physical ills. Members who know about Xenu will attempt to deny it or pretend like it doesn’t matter.  They are required to sign a contract binding them to silence on the matter.  Lower level members don’t know about Xenu & accordingly deny everything because they honestly don’t know.\n\nTo rid ourselves of ""Body Thetans"" & also “engrams” (past negative experiences stored in our unconscious mind) so that we can become “clear”, we have to go through ""auditing"" with a member of the “church” who uses an ""e-meter"" to measure our “reactive mind”...... & we have to pay lots & lots of money for “auditing” (purchased in 12.5-hour blocks, costing anywhere from $750 for introductory sessions to between $8,000 & $9,000 for advanced sessions) & to take courses on Scientology to advance to higher “levels” in the “church”. The “church” has also taken a very hostile stance towards psychiatry & psychiatric drugs irrespective of the fact that some people require medication to remain adequately functional in everyday life. They deny the reality of chemical imbalance & profound mental disturbance & accordingly do NOTHING to effectively stabilize the dangerously unstable. The “church” has been known to withhold prescription pharmaceuticals from member (with deadly results).\n\nScientology is undeniably a cult. For more information on what a cult is & what their damaging effects are, please visit the link provided at the bottom of the sources. Just know that Scientology DOES qualify by meeting these 5 criteria:\n\n(1) It uses psychological coercion to recruit, indoctrinate & retain its members. (2) It forms an elitist totalitarian society. (3) Its founder leader is self-appointed, dogmatic, messianic, not accountable & has charisma. (4) It believes 'the end justifies the means' in order to solicit funds & recruit people.

"We know that it is better to give than receive.  How many of us actually do it? Furthermore, who do we give to?  Do we give to those loving only us, or do we give unconditionally without reward or acknowledgment?  This is no judjment call; none of us ever gives enough, in my opinion.  What do you think?  And there are more ways to give than money, right? Giving does not have to be in the form of money. You can give a helping hand by helping someone cross the street, hold a door open, offer to babysit...etc There are so many ways one can be giving.

"Do people really have a sixth sense? Isn't having a ""gut-feeling"" mean something?  It's actually the 1st sense what is called as Instinct. All other living beings use it very effectively but unfortunately we humans have relegated it to 6th sense. Years and years of mediocre thinking and education based on rationality has made our instincts a vestigial sense. We have become too obsessed with logic and accept anything for which someone gives us a rational logic even if our instinct tells us that its not right. Please understand that the only thing logic has managed to do it to explain the things happening around us. No logic or science has been able to explain the most basic and the most beautiful things around us, for example\n1. Love. emotions, compassion - There is no logical or scientific explanation for this beautiful feeling.While there are thousands of researches and studies to explain the chemical or motor responses of brain to love, nothing explains why we feel in love with some people but hate others\n2. Beauty- Why do we find a flower beautiful, why does as innocent smile of a child makes us feel happy, why do we like the unending oceans\n3. Gravity - We humans have interpreted, measured and understood so many theories of gravity but yet no one can explain what is it that attracts a human body as well as a mineral rock with equal intensity. What is the form of magnetism\n4. God and spirituality \n\nIts all instincts that are so integrated to human as being and surely is the first sense",society_culture

"opinoins on slavery in the new world? i nedd opinons on slavery in the new world such as the slave rights, how it was justified and so on The 1926 Slavery Convention described slavery as ""...the status or condition of a person over whom any or all of the powers attaching to the right of ownership are exercised..."" Therefore, slaves cannot leave an owner or employer without explicit permission, and they will be returned if they escape. Therefore a system of slavery — as opposed to the isolated instances found in any society — requires official, legal recognition of ownership, or widespread tacit arrangements with local authorities, by masters who have some influence because of their social and/or economic status.\n\nThe word slave comes from the Latin term sclavus, which is thought to have originally referred to slavs, people from Eastern Europe, including parts of the Byzantine empire. The current usage of the word serfdom is not usually synonymous with slavery, because serfs are considered to have had some rights. In the strictest sense of the word, ""slaves"" are people who are not only owned, but who have no rights and are also not paid.\n\nThe International Labour Organization defines ""forced labour"" as ""all work or service which is extracted from any person under the menace of any penalty and for which the said person has not offered himself voluntarily"", albeit with certain exceptions: military service, convicts, emergencies and minor community services. [1]. The ILO asserts that child labour amounts to forced labour in which the child's work is exacted from the family as a whole.\n\nIn some historical contexts, compulsory labour to repay debts by adults has been regarded as slavery, depending upon the rights held by such individuals.\n\nMandatory military service in liberal democracies is a controversial subject: one view is that conscripts are not ""slaves"", as they have substantial legal rights, and any government which took it upon itself to implement conscription, outside a time of extreme national emergency, would eventually face a backlash at an election. Another view interprets acceptance of conscription as a sign of chauvinist, ultra-nationalist and/or fascist ideologies, justified by philosophies such as the Hegelian notion of nations having rights which supersede those of individuals.\n\nIn United States legal usage, the term involuntary servitude means a condition of labouring for another without one's willful consent. It does not necessarily mean the complete lack of freedom found in chattel slavery.\n\nMany left wing thinkers have discussed the idea of ""wage slavery"", although it is generally accepted that payment of a wage signifies ""free labour"", with the quite different disadvantages experienced by such workers.\n\nOrdinary citizens in totalitarian states are not generally considered slaves, as the only real point of comparison is restrictions on movement.",society_culture

I know about breast binding and dressing masculine, but how can I make my face look less feminine? How can I make my voice sound convincingly masculine? Finally, do you think that roundish/ovally glasses make a person look more feminine than if she were to wear contacts? Thank you. Someone already mentioned the hands. There are lots of other giveaways.\nMen typically have a prominent adam's apple, broader shoulders, the bulge in the trousers, larger feet, body hair, facial hair, as well as the lower voice.\n\nIf you want to pass, you can try spending some time with a recorder practicing with your voice. \nSpend some time watching how men walk, and practice that.\nSpend some time lifting weights and try to build some upper body strength and mass.\nYou might want to try a pair of larger shoes, padding them to fit your feet.\n\nWith your hands, you'll need some practice moving them in a bit less feminine manner. Women's hands are usually more graceful than men's, along with being smaller. If you can change that, you'll go a long way to making them appear less feminine.\n\nA theatrical make-up artist might help with some facial hair. \n\nThere's not alot you can do about the adam's apple, but there are a few men who don't have one. Just don't advertise it by looking upwards too often.\n\nIf you really want to pass, and you're seriious about doing so on a more permanent basis, you might try testosterone, which will add some facial hair and muscle mass. \n\nThe link below has some information, and some good links.",society_culture

"How would you interpret this scripture in Deuteronomy? ""YE shall not add unto the word which I command you, neither shall ye diminish ought from it, that ye may keep the commandments of the Lord your God which I command you.""  Deuteronomy 4:2 The thing about Deuteronomy is that it itself is a late addition to the scriptures. Leviticus, Numbers, Exodus and Genesis had been in existence in some form, not the finalized, edited versions we have today, for a long time.  But under the religious reforms of King Josiah in 622 BCE (see 2 Kings 22-23), a scroll was ""miraculously found"" hidden away in the Temple. This book that had been hidden away all those years was called Mishneh Torah, which in English is Second Law and in Greek is Deuteronomy. This book mostly consists of Moses standing in front of the Israelites reiterating everything that happened over the last 40 years since the Exodus and presenting the laws in new arrangements and a straightforward manner. It contains theological and legal themes not existent in the original conceptions of Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus and Numbers. Deuteronomy represents the works of the priestly and ruling classes to reinvigorate the Jews into piety. These themes conform to all the reforms which Josiah enacted, and it is believed by scholars to represent a reworking of Jewish law to conform to his revivalism. Furthermore, editors working in this period went through the old stories of Genesis etc. and wrote them down in the finalized versions we have today. In many parts of the Penteteuch this editing process is clear, such as the two different accounts of creation in Genesis and the different ways God is presented in the span of just a few chapters. This form of literary analysis is called redaction criticism, analyzing how editors made changes to the books they worked with to fulfil their own agendas.\n\nAll that being said, the author(s) of Deuteronomy wished to establish a final, codified, unchangable form of Israelite religion to combat the various forms of paganism and idolatry which spread throughout the land and was even endorsed by some kings (such as Ahab).",society_culture

"where is the scripture which talks about human sacrifices?  Lectio Divina is Latin for “spiritual reading” and represents an early monastic technique of prayer which continues in practice though less widely, intended to achieve communion with God as well as providing special spiritual insights and peace from that experience. It is a way of praying with Scripture that calls one to study, ponder, listen and, finally, pray from God's Word.\n\nHistory\nLectio Divina was first expressed in the year 220 AD. It was found that to read the Bible profitably it is necessary to do so with attention, consistency and prayer. The systematization of “spiritual reading” into four steps dates back to the 12th century. Around 1150, Guigo II, a Carthusian monk, wrote a book entitled “The Monk’s Ladder” (Scala Claustralium) wherein he set out the theory of the four rungs: reading, meditation, prayer and contemplation. In 2005, Pope Benedict XVI stated, “This is the ladder by which the monks ascend from earth to heaven.”\n\nMethod\nLectio is typically practiced daily for one continuous hour. A selection from the Holy Scriptures is chosen ahead of time, often as a daily progression through a particular book of the Bible.\n\nTime\nSelecting a time for lectio divina is important. Typical methods are to pray for one hour in the morning, or to divide it into two half-hour periods, one in the morning and one in the evening. The key is to pre-select the time that will be devoted to the prayer, and to keep it. Using the same time every day leads to a daily habit of prayer that becomes highly effective.\n\nPlace\nThe place for prayer is to be free from distractions. This means it should be isolated from other people, telephones, visual distractions, etc. Some find a religious icon to be helpful. The same place should be used for lectio if possible, especially as one first begins to practice it. Familiarity with a location reduces the possibility of distraction away from the prayer. Some practitioners conduct other devotions, such as praying before the Catholic Eucharist, as a preparation for Lectio Divina.\n\n Preparation\nPrior to reading, it is important to engage in a transitional activity that takes one from the normal state of mind to a more contemplative and prayerful state. A few moments of deep, regular breathing and a short prayer inviting the Holy Spirit to guide the prayer time helps to set the tone and improve the effectiveness of the lectio.\n\nOnce the stage is set it is time to begin the prayer. There are four phases of the prayer, which do not necessarily progress in an ordered fashion. One may move between different phases of the prayer very freely as the Spirit guides.\n\nThe Four Moments\nLectio\nRead the passage several times.\n\nMeditatio\nReflect on the text of the passage, thinking about how to apply to one's own life. Gravitate to any particular phrase or word that seems to be of particular import. This should not be confused with exegesis, but is a very personal reading of the Scripture and application to one's own life.\n\n Oratio\nRespond to the passage by opening the heart to God. This is not primarily an intellectual exercise, but more of the beginning of a conversation with God.\n\n Contemplatio\nListen to God. This is a freeing oneself from one's own thoughts, both mundane and holy. It is about hearing God talk to us. Opening our mind, heart and soul to the influence of God. Any conversation must allow for both sides to communicate, and this most unfamiliar act is allowing oneself to be open to hearing God speak.",society_culture

"The Nephillim, Angels Or Aliens? Ok, I just watched this video on youtube about the Giants in the bible, supposedly ""fallen angels"" that came down and mated w/ human women. The ppl commenting exclaimed how could the Nephillim ""however u spell it"" couldn't have been Angels for the simple reason that if Angels are Spirits according to the Bible, they would have no means to pro create b/c they have no reproductive organs, simple as that. Is this true?? Were they aliens? That is a scary thought!!!! NEPHILIM\n\n(Neph´i·lim) [Fellers; Those Who Cause [Others] to Fall Down].\n\nThis is a transliteration of the Hebrew word nephi·lim´, plural in its three occurrences in the Bible. (Ge 6:4; Nu 13:33 [twice]) It evidently stems from the causative form of the Hebrew verb na·phal´ (fall) as found, for example, in 2 Kings 3:19; 19:7.\n\nThe Bible account describing Jehovah’s displeasure with men in the days of Noah before the Flood relates that “the sons of the true God” took for themselves wives from among the attractive daughters of men. It then mentions the presence of “Nephilim,” saying: “The Nephilim proved to be in the earth in those days, and also after that, when the sons of the true God continued to have relations with the daughters of men and they bore sons to them, they were the mighty ones [Heb., hag·gib·bo·rim´] who were of old, the men of fame.”—Ge 6:1-4.\n\nIdentity. Bible commentators, considering verse 4, have offered several suggestions as to the identity of these Nephilim. Some have thought that the derivation of the name indicates that the Nephilim had fallen from heaven, that is, that they were ‘fallen angels’ who mated with women to produce “mighty ones . . . the men of fame.” Other scholars, focusing their attention particularly on the statement “and also after that” (vs 4), have said the Nephilim were not the ‘fallen angels’ or the “mighty ones,” since the Nephilim “proved to be in the earth in those days” before the sons of God had relations with women. These latter scholars hold the opinion that the Nephilim were simply wicked men like Cain—robbers, bullies, and tyrants who roamed the earth until they were destroyed by the Flood. Still another group, taking into consideration the context of verse 4, conclude that the Nephilim were not themselves angels, but were the hybrid offspring resulting from materialized angels having intercourse with the daughters of men.\n\nSame as “gib·bo·rim´.” Certain Bible translations adjust the location of the phrase “and also after that,” placing it near the beginning of verse 4, thus identifying the Nephilim with the “mighty ones,” the gib·bo·rim´, mentioned in the latter part of the verse. For example: “In those days, as well as afterward, there were giants [Heb., han·nephi·lim´] on the earth, who were born to the sons of the gods whenever they had intercourse with the daughters of men; these were the heroes [Heb., hag·gib·bo·rim´] who were men of note in days of old.”—Ge 6:4, AT; see also Mo, NIV, and TEV.\n\nThe Greek Septuagint also suggests that both the “Nephilim” and “mighty ones” are identical by using the same word gi´gan·tes (giants) to translate both expressions.\n\nReviewing the account, we see that verses 1 to 3 tell of “the sons of the true God” taking wives and of Jehovah’s statement that he was going to end his patience with men after 120 years. Verse 4 then speaks of the Nephilim proving to be in the earth “in those days,” evidently the days when Jehovah made the statement. Then it shows that this situation continued “after that, when the sons of the true God continued to have relations with the daughters of men,” and describes in more detail the results of the union of “the sons of the true God” with women.\n\nWho were the ‘sons of God’ that fathered the Nephilim?\n\nWho were “the sons of the true God” that were involved? Were they men who were worshipers of Jehovah (as distinguished from the general run of wicked mankind), as some claim? Evidently not. The Bible implies that their marriage to the daughters of men resulted in whipping up the badness in the earth. Noah and his three sons, along with their wives, were the only ones in God’s favor and were the only ones preserved through the Deluge.—Ge 6:9; 8:15, 16; 1Pe 3:20.\n\nHence, if these “sons of the true God” were merely men, the question arises, Why were their offspring",society_culture

"What, in Islam, happens to women when they die? I mean, we've all heard about the virgins for men and all that but what is supposed to happen to the women? Seriously, I'm really curious. Actually, there's nothing in the Quran that speaks of any number of virgins in heaven, that is just a stereotypical rumor that some have decided to spread against Islam.\n\nIt DOES however, mention a great ammount of ""houris"" which is a non-gendered creature of light and beauty (no mention of any sexual nature), and is meant for both the men AND the women. No one is certain what their purpose is, we can only speculate.\n\nTo further answer your question, the descriptions of heaven aren't meant only for a man or woman, but both genders enjoy all of it's bounties. What few descriptions are given aren't necessarily and exact of heaven itself, but merely the best representation that can be given to us at this time. God tells us that even our greatest imaginations of the beauty and bounties of heaven cannot compare to the real thing, as it is beyond our understanding. So when the Quran describes heaven as ""gardens beneath which rivers flow"" it is simply giving us a small explanation in the best way that we can understand. The holy lands rest in the mostly barren deserts, so to describe that the heavens will consist of gardens and springs (""beneath which rivers flow"") is showing the desert folk just how rewarding it can be, so that they will work for it, making the best of this life in preparation for the next.\nI hope this helped you.",society_culture

"What is the story behind kissing under the mistletoe?  Ancient Romans believed that mistletoe had the magic power of peace. If opposing soldiers met under a mistletoe covered tree they would temporarily put down their weapons and declare peace for the day. In later times, in both England and Scandinavia, it was customary to hang mistletoe over doorways. Anyone who passed under supposedly came in peace and was greeted in a friendly manner, perhaps with a kiss. This probably accounts for the current custom of kissing under the mistletoe,\n\nOne Scandinavian legend states that Loki, the god of destruction, killed Baldur, the god of peace, by shooting him with an arrow made from mistletoe. Other gods and goddesses were saddened by Baldur's death and asked that his life be restored, which it was. In appreciation, his mother, Frigga, hung up the mistletoe and promised to kiss all who passed under it. Because of this, mistletoe became the symbol of both forgiveness and love.",society_culture

"is there an effective way of becoming/learning to be funny and spontaneous?  Depends what level of funny you want to achieve.  Toilet humor funny is pretty much easy. Prepackaged jokes wouldn't come up to your standard of being ""spontaneous"" and all you'll require for them is proper timing which is a skill you can learn with lots of practice. Sarcasm and Irony as humor is the hardest one to achieve since you will have to be witty, observant and have an off-color sense of humor to pull this one off.  Just practice voicing out your comments to yourself (which you usually keep in your head) when you think something is funny and you'll come up with the right quip or witticism at the appropriate time.",society_culture
"Will the Heaven bound be no more than slaves to Dictator? Most of what is done by humans on earth is a sin, most of your joys and pleasures are sin.

Would Heaven not be just a place ruled by a Dictator who imposes laws upon you, laws that threaten your very character, and punishes if you think outside of his word.  ""Comform or Suffer"" written atop the pearly gates. During the Middle Ages, the Roman Catholic church came up with a list of 9 levels of angelcraft, including Archangels, Cherubim, Seraphim, Nephilim etc. This 'caste' list, or hierarchy, is now denied by the Papacy, as they now want people to believe that heaven is a classless society. The papacy also used to give plaques to wealthy donors, which were interred with the body upon death, and granted the owner a step up the ladder of pergutory; despite Jesus' own words regarding the difficulties of wealthy men entering heaven.\nIt seems to me that Heaven changes according the wind direction of the day, and is probably as corrupt as any Orwellian totalitarian state, and somewhere I should doubtlessly hate to spend infinity.",society_culture

That is a good question, ESPECIALLY when God said that he will do away with Wars once and for all (Isa. 2:4, Dan. 2:44) Why would a God fearing person want to go to war if God himself said he was going to do away with wars.  There is no issue about freedom here, because if we belong to Christ, as Christians state, they already ARE free.\n\nAdd on top of that the fact that war is murder and murderers will not inherit God's kingdom  (Rev. 21:8)  True Christians would not go to, or support, war.",society_culture

"Child sacrifice as religious practice? Today's OT Scripture reading included Abraham's readiness to sacrifice Isaac.  Apparently this was practised by some of the tribes in Abraham's day as a religious offering.  It made me think about abortion today.\n\nMost people would be up in arms with a religion that asked for child sacrifice.  Most people in the western world would claim to think for themselves rather than blindly follow the dictates of any authority.\n\nI think women who have an abortion do so with regret.  My question is; what higher purpose is being served by having an abortion?  And would the women (and the father if consulted) who have taken this course of action, still hold that for them, that higher purpose, is still more important. The higher purpose in permitting it is to affirm that every person should shall have full jurisdiction over what happens inside the boundaries of his/her body.  Therefore by permitting it we are acknowledging that the freedom of a person to control their own body is more important than other considerations.  However we are not endorsing the choices they make as ""good"".  We are merely choosing not to intervene forcefully in a person's excersise of thier soverign rights over their body.  In this light, persuasion and dialog become the tools of those who wish to stop the practice, not the threat of imprisonment or execution by the government (there are people out there who believe that it is murder and should be punished with death).  \n\nYour second question becomes irrelavent unless you believe that you or the government has a role in determining how a person should be permitted to exersise control over what goes on inside thier body.\n\nHuman sacrifice is ritualistic religious killing of a person in order to gain some favor with a God that they fear, in hopes that they will be granted some sort of boon from their god, such as good weather or reprieve from a plague.

Can a question about Religion be answered without disrespecting other people or refusing to answer a question seriously? Its doubtful that a statement regarding religion has ever been made without offending someone. In the world of religious discussion we have the offense provokers, and the easily offended. I think how one approaches the communication of their personal thought on religion depends on the forum in which the encounter is taking place.\n  For example, on a first date, its best to avoid religious discussion altogether (especially if you remembered to bring a condem). \n  \nIn church, its best to agree with whatever is said. (especially if you want to be invited to the after-ceremony donuts)\n  \nIn casual discussion over dinner, you should be firm about why you think your viewpoint is right, but its probably best to avoid pointing out why your dinner quests viewpoint is wrong. (unless you want a pork-chop rammed up your bung)\n\nHaving said that, I think that a religious DEBATE is different. In an intellectual debate, there is nothing wrong with pointing out the flaws in another's theory or viewpoint. This is a part of what debating means. If someone is offended by criticism of their viewpoint in a debate, then they dont understand what debating entails. What we should always try to avoid however, is personal attacks. Its perfectly fine to attack one's views in a debate, but never to attack the debater themselves. So, a statement such as ""Your theory about vanilla ice cream leading to orgasms is unlikely to be true because ice cream does not stimulate the sympathetic nervous system"" are fine, but you should not say ""It figures you would think vanilla ice cream causes orgasms because you can not get a date"".\n  \nHaving said all that....GOD DOESN'T EXIST..SO THERE!!",society_culture

"What is the exact physical location of heaven and hell - in your opinion.? I do not believe, personally, that there is an actual physical plain which is heaven or hell.

Just as easy to put your hand around as a daydream or a nightmare, just as disturbing or exciting.  If you know at the time of your death that you have made your peace with your Creator then your mind is literally at ease and your soul will depart from the shell it has occupied and you will cross over into the dimension you create for yourself.  Jesus said that heaven is within each of us.  Conversely, if you know that you've been a heel your entire life - your most horrible nightmare will curse you for eternity.  Any thoughts?

Many people think that learning a language that doesn't help you get more money is a crazy thing because they see life as a race for happiness and success. Knowledge means power so learning an international language can give you a better chance to get a successful job and the respect of all your teammates, is the perfect thing to do if you want a fast career growth.\n\n ''We only have one life so why waste it with stupid things like learning a foreign language. Why learn something if you don't get money for it? I rather have some fun, drink a beer and f*** someone than stay at home all day long with a book in my hands learning some stupid crap. '' is a practical way of thinking for most of the people in the world, I heard this many times before and I'm sure I will hear it again, I can't do nothing about it, nobody can change someone's mind. I know how you feel but people are all different so you must see your own business and let the others speak as long as they want about how ''stupid'' you are...they will never understand what you feel. Remember that learning foreign languages also helps you improve your memory and speaking skills so you musn't be ashamed of what you like.\n\nThe love for foreign languages is in my blood, it always was my hobby and I think it will always be. I started learning my first language (except my native one) when I was 8 years old, now I know 4 different languages and I learn the 5th one. I don't think learning is a stupid thing because I feel happy doing it, I can speak with new people and find out more about their culture and their customs. I know that maybe I will never visit Turkey but I still learn their language because this way I can be closer to the person I'm speaking with,  we can be good, intimate friends and for me this is all that matters. \n\nFor me english is a foreign language but I didn't learn it just for the fact that it is an international language and would help me get a better job, I learned english because I wanted to understand what other people are saying, because I'm a curious person and I always want to know new thing about the world that I live in. \n\nI can't ask people to understand my passion because I know they can't but I hope that in the future more people will be willing to learn a new language for the pleasure of learning it not just for business. Language is the soul of a culture and throught speaking we can all become friends.",society_culture
"Do you think that just b/c jesus died for our sins, we can get away with more sins? I think people these days are using him as more of an excuse to continue to act the way they do.  B/c they say ""Jesus died for my sins no matter what I'll be forgiven""  What do you think? The whole of Galatians is arguing against that line of reasoning - if we sin we disobey God! Christians should obey Him!\n\nGalatians 2:\n16 Knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Jesus Christ, that we might be justified by the faith of Christ, and not by the works of the law: for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified.\n\n 17 But if, while we seek to be justified by Christ, we ourselves also are found sinners, is therefore Christ the minister of sin? God forbid. \n\n1 Corinthians 3:\n16 Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?\n\n 17 If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which temple ye are.\n\nRead 1 Corinthians 5 (see link)\n\n1 Corinthians 6:\n9 Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind,\n\n 10 Nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God. \n\n1 Corinthians 6:\n15 Know ye not that your bodies are the members of Christ? shall I then take the members of Christ, and make them the members of an harlot? God forbid. \n\n18 Flee fornication. Every sin that a man doeth is without the body; but he that committeth fornication sinneth against his own body.\n\n 19 What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own?\n\n 20 For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God's.\n\netc........\n\n\n>Other than that one, Christians are free to commit as many sins as they want, as often as they want, and any kind they want.<\n\nThe person who wrote that is totally and utterly WRONG!",society_culture

I love her and want to work on it but i dont know what to do to get me to feel the way i felt when i first meet her.\nPlease Help I recommend writing about this yourself first of all.  Try jounaling or even writing it in a letter to her.  It always works best for me to get my own thoughts and feelings worked out completely before tackling something like this.  You need to look back and think about what you first felt when you met her.  Why did you feel that way?  Once you identify those things, it will be easier to work on bringing them back into your relationship.  \n\nI have been with my partner for just over five years and went through something similar.  For me it was the fact that when we first met, we were eachother's first priority.  We got dressed up for eachother. We tried to impress eachother still.  Now, our first priority is usually letting the dogs outside and figuring out what's for dinner.  It's not sexy or new or romantic anymore.  To combat this we've tried to plan ahead and build suspense.  For instance, even though we've lived together for a very long time, we try to plan a date.  We make sure the house is cleaned, homework is done, the bed is made, dinner is planned and groceries are purchased ahead of time.  Sometimes we still shower and get dressed up for eachother instead of just hanging around the house in our frumpy clothes.  We light candles.  We drink wine.  Sometimes we go out for dinner and a movie.  We make sure to really pay attention to eachother when we're talking.  \n\nAnyhow, that's just one suggestion.  You need to figure out what exactly it is that you're missing so you can figure out how to get it back.  Also, talk to her about this and let her know how you feel (of course be nice and tactful, don't attack her or it will be counter-productive).  She might be feeling the same way and you'll certainly make more progress if you work on this as a couple.

No disrespect intended but since it was prophesied that the Messiah was to ride in on a donkey, wouldn't he just have happened to be on one already?

"Do you think it's more socially acceptable for men to be overweight than women? Do you think it's more socially acceptable for men to be overweight than women?\nthis issue was raised on a topical discussion i heard last night. someone brought up the issue that being underweight was quite 'acceptable', yet an overweight woman was not!? what do you think? While I think both are frowned upon in our fitness and weight obsessed society, I definitely think that it is more acceptable for a man to be overweight than a woman.\n\nI also totally agree that people think it is ok for a woman to be underweight, and overweight is not.\n\nI'm not overweight, but I'm not thin either, I'm just stalky, short, and have some curves, and I am considered ""fat"" while I have a friend who looks like she is extrmely malnourished and like the wind could blow her over, and that is considered attractive.\n\nI'm very healthy, I exercise regularly, eat well, take my vitamins, etc. but I'm just not obsessed with being thin. My husband loves me as I am, and I am not unhealthy, so why should I try and starve myself into a size zero?\n\nBlame it on society and the media. The media pushes these TOTALLY unrealistic photos of what ""beauty"" is supposed to be. Women who are airbrushed, made up, and have their clothes taped exactly the right way. It's sad that this causes so many young women to think that they are ugly or fat, simply because they do not fit an unrealistic idea of beauty.\n\nI think what we need are more campaigns like that of ""Dove"" and their campaign for ""real beauty"".

I've read many questions directed at Christians some are insulting some are not, some just curious about their faith..and that's what my question is..curious, not to disrespect anyone's view point believer or non-believer is my goal. My question involves ""love"". Love for each other, our families, our children and mate. If there is no God, is love nothing more than neurons connecting to synapses and sparking feelings of pleasure, is love just neurotransmitters transmitting from our DNA a sense of ""Good"". If it is why isn't that found in hallmark cards, Like: ""You make my neurons happy through billions of years of evolution""..if that's the truth! Is love something more than that, is it more than sparking neurons? When I look into the face of my children I can honestly say ""It's more than that"". I know I will spend eternity with them like I know I will see the sun again..I can feel it. I would like to have your views..your thoughts.\n\nRespectfully, your friend Yes, love is a chemical reaction.  We don't say that for the same reason we still speak of sunset and sunrise, despite knowing that the sun is not really moving around the earth.  It's the same reason that we say ""full moon"" despite knowing that the moon is always full and it just reflects different amount of sunlight to earth as it spins around us.

"Are you proud of your Southern accent? Many Southerners are made to feel like they are not as smart because of their accents--especially by people from places like Michigan.  Are you proud of your Southern accent, or do you wish to get rid of it? I live in North GA, and there are a lot of hillbillies here(me included.) I would much rather speech Hillbilly than general American accent because it makes me feel special.  How do you feel about your accent? I'm from Minnesota. I once went on a mission trip to St. Louis, and we were pretty much the only remotely northern youth group there. So we were the ones who had a funny accent XD (I distinctly remember this guy from Texas coming up to us, imploring us to ""say 'Minnesota'!"" Once we'd said it, he got all excited and was all like ""DUDE! That totally just made my day!!""). And the pastor there once referred to one of my group leaders as ""mah friend Kathy frum Minnesooooda"" (imitating the famed Minnesota ""O"" sound). It was rather entertaining, I must say.\n\nI think there are drawbacks to that particular accent, though. First of all, when you're singing choral pieces you're supposed to have an open ""O"" sound, which, as a southerner, you naturally lack (no offense intended). I know of one conductor who was thoroughly frustrated with her choir because of this very thing. Also, sometimes it's a little difficult to understand when it's particularly heavy--though it's much more comprehensible than a heavy Scottish accent (sometimes it sounds like they're not even speaking English!). \n\nSo, in answer to your question, I do not have a southern accent, so I cannot be proud of it. But I think that that particular accent is a small part of America's charm.",society_culture

"Why are there several religions? Muslims, Hinduisms, Catholic, Mormons, etc. etc... Why are there several religions? since they all have the same objectives, and the same God. sometimes they fight, and even kill for their belief. why?!?! As a Hindu we are taught that God is big and vast. It is taught that there are so many religions because every person experiences God differently. These experiences, along with differing desired spiritual goals, are the main reason why there are so many religions.\n\nThere is a simple story told about four blind men who walk in a forest. Each of them comes across an elephant, briefly. One touches the trunk of the elephant, another only its ear. Another man touches the tail, and the fourth one touches the body. Each of these four men have had an individual encounter with an elephant. Each of them was only able to touch a part of the elephant for the brief time the elephant was passing. To each of them an elephant is a very different thing. The meaning is that God is like the elephant. He is big and when we reach to touch God, we can only touch a small part. There are different religions because each of us is touching a different part of the elephant, each religion has touched a different part of God. Religions don't all necessarily have the same goals, either. Yes they want to promote peace and unity, but think for a moment....some want to go to Heaven and be with their personalize manifested experience of God, like Jesus, Krishna. Some people want to just see their family and ancestors in Heaven and some want to experience the paradise of Heaven. Some aren't reaching for Heaven at all, but merely finding peace right now in this life and experiencing God right now, in this moment and not concerned with a future. These are all very different spiritual goals, all touching different parts of God. God manifested to them in various different ways and thus we react to the experiences that those manifestations bring.\nWhy do religions fight? It is usually over not being respectful of other's experiences and trying to force others to experience what they experience. Sometimes conflicts aren't even really about religion at all, but since religion is expressions of our deepest Self, these conflicts begin to get expressed by us in the only way we can understand such things, through our religion.",society_culture

By the end of Judgment Day, surviving humans will have “come to life” fully as perfect humans. (Revelation 20:5) Judgment Day will thus see the restoration of mankind to its original perfect state. (1 Corinthians 15:24-28) Then a final test will take place. Satan will be released from his imprisonment and allowed to try to mislead mankind one last time. (Revelation 20:3, 7-10) Those who resist him will enjoy the complete fulfillment of the Bible’s promise: “The righteous themselves will possess the earth, and they will reside forever upon it.” (Psalm 37:29) Yes, Judgment Day will be a blessing to all faithful mankind!\n\nThe Messianic Kingdom will fully accomplish God’s original purpose for the earth. \nAll who survive the execution of Jehovah’s judgment on this old system will work unitedly under Christ the King, gladly doing whatever he directs, so that the earth becomes a global paradise.\nAll mankind will enjoy the work of their hands and benefit fully from the abundance of earth’s produce.\n\nUnder Kingdom rule, earth’s inhabitants will realize marvelous physical benefits. “At that time the eyes of the blind ones will be opened, and the very ears of the deaf ones will be unstopped. At that time the lame one will climb up just as a stag does, and the tongue of the speechless one will cry out in gladness.” (Isaiah 35:5, 6) Flesh disfigured by age or disease will become fresher than that of a child, and chronic weaknesses will give way to vigorous health. \nThe day will come when no one will have reason to say, “I am sick.” Why? Because God-fearing humans will be relieved of the burden of sin and its grievous effects.\nIsaiah foretold, “righteousness is what the inhabitants of the productive land will certainly learn.” (2 Peter 3:13; Isaiah 26:9) This quality leads to peace—between people of all races, among close associates, in one’s family and, above all, with God himself.\n\nBy the end of the thousand years of Kingdom rule, the human family will have been restored to perfection of mind and body. The earth will be a global garden of Eden, a paradise. Peace, happiness, security, and a loving human society will have been attained.

The rest of it always existed as a consequence of that which we call the Heisenburg Indeterminancy Principle (HIP). A vacuum with 0EV as its vacuum energy (aka: zero-point energy) would be perfectly determinable and a violation of the HIP.\n\nThis initial baseline is known as the inflaton.\n\nImagine a big rubber sheet, infinitely long and wide, and extremely thin. The thing will be vibrating fairly randomly just from the non-zero zeropoint energy. These energy fluctuations propagate as waves. Get enough waves adding up, and you'll get some pretty high crests and valleys. Get a big enough deviation, and you'll stretch the rubber in that immediate area so much that its elasticity will change. This is analgous to a vacuum phase change. In the rubber, the sudden rearrangement of the molecules will be released as heat, in a vacuum phase change, the potential energy is released as a massive swelling of spacetime and particles. It's as though the hill gets so high that the rubber loses a great deal of its elasticity and spreads out hugely because it no longer has the same force pulling it back to itself.\n\nIts presence in the rubber sheet will remain only the size of the original hill. Its internal size however, will be much, MUCH larger. This also extends to the real situation. Within the inflaton, the whole universe, our visible universe is smaller than planck scale. However, internally, we're so big that our universe would literally be spawning nearly infinitely many universes itself. We can't see them because they are sub-planck to us, nor can they see us because we are behind their inflationary wall. Inflation happens at speeds that are superluminal, so causality breaks down at this point. The interesting thing of the wall though is that it perfectly MAINTAINS causality.\n\nLong story short: what we see started, randomly. Where it exists had to ALWAYS exist, it could not have not existed.\n\n-------------\n\nThe inflaton isn't being damped. Quantum wave functions are perfect in that regard -- they aren't ACTUAL waves... or they are waves propagated by lossless particles... or... well... you seem an intelligent gent, I'm sure you realize quantum physics has some non-normal takes on a few things. It's sufficient to say that quantum wave functions are fundamental. The vacuum energy of a vacuum is a constant. In fact, it's possible via quantum tunneling for a vacuum's energy to increase in a small area, and this itself would cause a propagative state change.\n\nLet us say, for example, that the base inflaton has a 10 ^ 100 EV baseline. Our visible universe's particular vacuum state has something significantly lower (I don't recall off the top of my head -- a single cubic centimeter contains enough vacuum energy to boil off earth's oceans though). Let's say 10 ^ 90 EV. Because of the nature of quantum randomness, it is possible for a sub-planck fluctuation to momentarily jump to 10 ^ 110. If that fluctuation then spawned a sub-universe, it's vacuum energy might be 10^100 EV -- the same as the original inflaton, more than the 'parent' universe.\n\nThere, by the way, is your quantum entropy. The average total of all universes' vacuum energies would be fluctuating around a central point in a probablistic manner.",society_culture

Most eastern practician such as Buddhism, Hindu, Taoist are able to see this light through medication and spiritual/mental training.\n\nHowever documenting and captures trails of soul is another matter.\n\nIn Buddhism, it is said that soul/spirit exist in another plane / dimension that co-exist with ours. They have soceity and bounds just like our soceity, their sense of time is also different than ours.  Approximately our sense of 1 month of time equals their 1 day.  Besides from that there are lost soul/spirit that did not make the transition to the other side and linger in our plane because they still reminisce their relatives or belonging, these spirits are the ghost that people sometimes see at night.\n\nThe soul resides in the body, Taoist believe its position is like a infant in a upside down position in your abdominal area in your stomach.  However, no science or experiment can confirm this finding/myth so far.\n\nScience today is still trying to make the breakthrough to understand these metaphysic events, although progress seems slow.  Most western religion belive these things can not be capture on film or scientificly quantify, because its God's work and is hidden from us for a reason.\n\nEither way, its still a big mistery...",society_culture

"why aren't fish crushed by water pressure?  Mainly because they're filled with water, and don't have to breathe air.  We have difficulty at depths that don't bother fish because we have open cavities in our bodies (such as the periteneal sac around our abdomenal organs), and our lungs need to expand for us to take in air.\n\nHowever, there are still limits to the depths to which many fish can dive.  Buoyancy regulation in bony fishes is controlled through the swim bladder.  By contracting or relaxing the bladder, it essentially changes the density of the fish and they can rise or sink in the water column.  Below certain depths though, the swim bladder becomes too contracted, and can even be crushed, and the fish can die or be unable to return to safer depths.\n\nDeep sea fish (like those weird angler fish and gulper eels and others) have a variety of adaptations that allow them to survive under such intense pressures.  Other critters, like octopus and crabs and tube worms have other adaptations, but most of them involve making sure there's no sealed body cavities that can be compressed by deep ocean pressures.",science_mathematics

"Does digital information degrade when copied (even minutely) in spite of error checking due to entropic forces I am making the argument that digital media, while very reliable still must succumb to the forces of nature. I am not saying that a CD in the sun will degrade, thats obvious. What I am saying is that any file, copied enough times regardless of the error checking inherent to digital systems will eventually be very different from the original. Copying a digital file, by definition, always gets you an exact duplicate. The media you save it to may degrade, but the digital file will not change via entropy.\n\nHere is the main difference between analog and digital. In digital, the information is stored as a series of numbers. To make sure that the numbers don't change, they are stored with things called ""checksums"". Basically a mathematical formula that comes up with a number that represents the block of data.\n\nSo let's say for sake of argument, we use a really simple checksum. Add up all the numbers and call that sum our checksum. And say for sake of argument, the data numbers are 200, 200, 200, 200 and 200, so the checksum is 1,000.\n\nThe digital file would have the five ""200's"" and the number 1,000 as a checksum.\n\nNo when you send the file, the receiving computer gets the five ""200's"" and the number 1,000. It adds up the 200's, gets the sum of 1,000, and now knows for certain, that the digital data is correct.\n\nNow lets say something does happen, and one of the numbers changes via entropy, sunspots, solar flares, or the fact that its Tuesday, and one of the 200's becomes 199. The receiving computer adds up the numbers and gets 999, so it knows the data is bad. It will ask the originating computer to resend the data. If it fails again, it will declare the file invalid, and you will not get a copy.\n\nThat's the beauty of digital. If the numbers don't add, the copy is invalid. So the supposition that the data in future files will be different is incorrect.\n\nAs I mentioned before, media CAN go bad. So if you put information on a hard disk, tape, CD or DVD, any of these can go bad. But that is a failure of the media, not the digtal transfer.\n\nIf you copy a digital file 1,000 times, 10,000 times, or 100 million times, it will always end up the same.\n\nAdditional information:\n> So what happens when a 200\n> becomes 199 and another becomes\n> 201. You still get 1000.\n\nExcellent question!\n\nI gave a pretty rudamentary example of a checksum. In real life, checksum algorithms, CRC being the most popular (Cyclic redundancy check - See Wikipedia article referenced below). \n\nCRC calculations rotate through all the values during calculation, so it's clear when one byte has changed. Think of it like this. If we take my previous example, but we did it for each digit, like this.\n200 = checksum of 200\n200 + 200 = checksum of 400\n200 + 200 + 200 = checksum of 600\n\nThe end result would be the that any one data byte changing is reflected in the checksum. But the file would get pretty big. Logorithmically!\n\nBut if you add up the check sums, you end up with one number, that verfies the value of every individual byte!\n\nSo let's apply this to your example (but lets make it three digits so this answers isn't huge!)\n200 = 1st checksum is 200\n200 + 200 = second checksum is 400\n200 + 200 + 200 = third checksum is 600\nTotal checksum is 1200.\n\nNow lets apply the error you introduced\n200 = 1st checksum is 200\n200 + 199 = second checksum is 399\n200 + 199 + 201 = third checksum is 600.\nTotal checksum is 1,199!\n\nSo even though the error gets past a simple summary checksum, it doesn't pass a cyclic summary. And it doesn't take up any additional space.\n\nNow the CRC algorithm is actually more complex than this, so it checksums on many levels. The file you start with is perfectly duplicated every time, or it will fail to copy at all.",science_mathematics

"Where do radar in dolphins come from?  Most dolphins have acute eyesight both in and out of the water and their sense of hearing is superior to that of humans. Though they have a small ear opening on each side of their head it is believed hearing underwater is also if not exclusively done with the lower jaw which conducts the vibrations to the middle ear via a fat filled cavity in the lower jaw bone. Hearing is also used for echolocation which seems to be an ability all dolphins have. The dolphin's sense of touch is also well-developed.\n\nHowever, dolphins lack an olfactory nerve and thus have no sense of smell, but they can taste and do show preferences for certain kinds of fish. Since dolphins spend most of their time below the surface in the wild, just tasting the water could act in a manner analogous to a sense of smell.",science_mathematics

"why in matrices the principal diagonal called so? and why the other diagonal has no name?  The principal diagonal is the most useful diagonal in the study of matrix algebra because it is related to several invariants. \nIf M and N are two matrices of the same linear transformation with respect to different bases, then their trace (the sum of the entries on the principal diagonal) is the same.\nA transformation that can be represented as a scaling of n independent vectors in an n-dimensional space has a diagonal representation in that space under a suitable change of bases (namely to those vectors it scales, called eigenvectors). The product of the entries of the diagonal in that representation is another invariant, called the determinant (it is the signed volume of a parallelepiped made up of the basis vectors after the transformation). The determinant is another important invariant that you will see all over the place in differential geometry.\nThe other diagonals do have names (the superdiagonal is on top of the principal, subdiagonal is on the bottom of the principal, etc.) but they are so rarely important that they have fallen out of fashion. See the source for more details.",science_mathematics
"Does DNA replication occur immediately after asexual reproduction, sexual reproduction or both?  DNA replication occurs when the cell needs to reproduce.  When the volume of the cell outgrows its surface area, a set of chemical signals are sent out notifying the DNA to begin replicating.  Asexual reproduction (fission) is the most common form of cell asexual reproduction.  Before sexual reproduction can occur you must first produce the gametes (sperm-eggs).  Here the DNA is replicated but then it is cut in half to produce the haploid gametes.  When the sperm and egg unite then the full complement of DNA returns.

I wonder if the goverment stoped the discussion . there must have been some kind of break truough. what answers does anyone have. There are a lot of theories about space and time, but I like what a Tom Stoppard character said in the play ""Arcadia"".  He said one can quickly stir marmalade into porridge, but can NOT stir it back out . \n\nThis is a parable or metaphor for pointing out that time is a framework of process, and most processes-- such as entropy, for example-- move in only one direction.  Although one can run a video backwards, no one in reality can unbake a cake separating it into flour, chocolate, baking powder and other ingredients, nor send the merest slice of chocolate cake ""back in time"" to co-exist with the flour, chocolate and baking powder of its former existence. \n\n Sending YOU back to live with your ancestors-- you, who, no doubt, have a few atoms and molecules in you from nearly every human being who ever lived-- would be like trying to get a speck of jelly stirred out of the porridge, unbaking a cake:  reversing a process that is complete already!  In time, of course, the process of baking the cake will reverse itself in a way, for the cake, one way or another, will vanish, in the entropy of cakes represented by chewing, digestion, spoiling in the refrigerator, getting stale and being thrown in the garbage for flies and maggots.  But in no sense can a time machine be built to send the least crumb of cake, the least excuse for a man, back in time.\n\n And this is because time is a correlative function of whatever processes occur within a given time frame. Time, whether it speeds up or slows down under certain conditions as claimed in the theory of relativity-- is a process that could not work in reverse! (I don't ""know"" this, but am convinced-- which, to an old man, is the same thing!) \n\nThink:  If we went back to the time of Alexander, and our 21st century body had one of the atoms in it that formerly had belonged to Alexander, who would get the atom?  If you had ""inherited"" a patch of skin or a nose from a Native American contemporary of Alexander, who'd get the nose?  Would it, out of courtesy, fly off of his face and snap onto your face, just because you had managed to travel back in time?  There is a rule that is unarguable:  only one person can use a particular atom or a particular molecule of water at a time.  \n\n The other kind of ""time travel""--  freezing people and animals into ""corpsicles"" to be thawed out in ten thousand years-- might seem like time travel to the person surviving the ""thaw cycle"", but in reality it would not be,  for inducing suspended animation through freezing would not affect ""time"", it would merely arrest or slow the universal entropy of living things-- aging-- and delay the universal ""extreme entropy"" experienced ultimately by all who live:  death! \n\n I have been fascinated by suspended animation since, as a child,  I once practiced it: freezing in a block of ice a small fish I caught in a pond, leaving it in the freezer, putting the block of ice back in the pond, and watching the fish swim away.  The fish was swimming at the same rate as he was before I caught him, and, also,  the fish through the entire process ""traveled in time"" at the same rate as the rest of us, and didn't need a machine-- a Montgomery Ward refrigerator or an Alley Oop time machine-- to do it.  If the freezing didn't hurt its health, the freezing merely delayed its death by the couple of weeks it lay frozen in our freezing compartment.\n\nFish and men, civilizations and stars,  are born, go through certain changes and processes, then they die and can never more be revisited.

"where do you find information about the caribbean plate?  The Caribbean Plate is an oceanic tectonic plate that encompasses roughly 3.2x106 km² and underlies Central America and the Caribbean Sea off the north coast of South America. The Caribbean Plate borders the North American Plate, the South American Plate, and the Cocos Plate. These borders are hotspots for seismic activity, including frequent earthquakes and tremors, occasional tsunamis, and volcanic eruptions.\n\nThe northern boundary with the North American plate is a transform or strike-slip boundary which runs from the border area of Belize, Guatemala, and Honduras in Central America, eastward through the Cayman trough on south of the southeast coast of Cuba, and just north of Hispaniola, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands. Part of the Puerto Rico Trench, the deepest part of the Atlantic Ocean (roughly 8400 meters), lies along this border. The Puerto Rico trench is at a complex transition from the subduction boundary to the south and the transform boundary to the west.\n\nThe eastern boundary is a subduction zone formed as the westward moving North American Plate plunges under the Caribbean Plate. Subduction forms the volcanic islands of the Lesser Antilles island arc from the Virgin Islands in the north to the islands off the coast of Venezuela in the south. This boundary contains seventeen active volcanoes, most notably Soufriere Hills on Montserrat, Mount Pelée on Martinique, La Grande Soufrière on Guadeloupe, Soufrière Saint Vincent on Saint Vincent, and the submarine volcano Kick-'em-Jenny which lies about 10 km north of Grenada.\n\nFor More:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caribbean_Plate",science_mathematics
"hardy-weinberg question? tricky stuff!? Heterozygosity in sickle-cell anemia provides resistence against malaria. If 9% of an African population is born with a severe form of sickle-cell anemia (recessive), what percentage of the more resistant allele is present in that population? AA = p(squared)\nAa = 2pq\naa = q(squared)\np + q = 1\n\nFirst you need to interpret ""9% have the disease"". This means that 9% of the population have both recessive alleles, which means the frequency of aa is 0.09. You are asked to calculate the percentage (or frequency) of the resistant (or dominant allele), which is denoted A. So by using the above equations:\n\naa = 0.09, which can also be expressed as a(squared) = 0.09\n\na = square root of a(squared) = square root of 0.09 = 0.3\n\nThe recessive allele (a in this case) is always donated by q, and the dominant allele (A in this case) is always denoted by p. So therefore; a = q.\n\np + q = 1\np + 0.3 = 1\np = 1 - 0.3\np = 0.7\n\nSince p = A, the frequency of the dominant allele (A) equals 0.7",science_mathematics

"What role does carbon dioxide play in the greenhouse effect?  The temperature on earth is the result of the way the earth absobs energy from the light of the sun.  Scientists look at something called the albedo of the planet, which is a measure of how much light shines on the planet versus how much bounces back.  Most of the atmosphere is nitrogen and oxygen.  Carbon dioxide is different than these two gases, because it absorbs more light energy than they do.  The more energy it absorbs, the less is reflected, meaning that there is more energy--in the form of heat--being deposited on earth by the sun.  Since CO2 absorbs more energy, the more of it there is in the atmosphere means that the planet gets a lower albedo, meaning less light is reflected and more light is turned into heat.  The more heat we absorb, the hotter it gets--much like how a green house works, and hence the name.",science_mathematics

"How can i power my semi conductor ICs using a car battery? I heared that a car battery delivers 12V,30A supply. but my ic specifications says that my workable limit is under 1A. what should i do? i need clear explanation and if possible with a schematic... and width of wire too which i must use.. The above answers about using a voltage regulator sound ok.  Just make sure to check out the regulator's data sheet so that it can safely regulate what DC voltage you are giving it (though with this 12V case you shouldn't have a problem).\n\nAlso, when a battery is rated at 12V, 30A the battery doesn't necessarily output 30A at all times; that is just a full load rating given for safety reasons (don't want to overload the battery).  The battery is a constant voltage source so you can certainly have a load that pulls much less than 30A.\n\nWidth of wire?  You shouldn't be too concerned with this at these low voltages.  Just use breadboard type wire (around 22 AWG I believe).\n\nAlso, one final comment from me... why use a car battery when you can use a more convenient source of DC voltage?  If you want something that can conveniently power your IC's try one of those nifty AC/DC plugs that charge cell phones and the like.  They are rated in various output voltages and can surely supply all the current your IC's will need.  Just cut off the DC plug end and strip the wire.  Boom, now you have DC voltage for your breadboard supply terminals or whatever.",science_mathematics

"is there a installation system for building windows that withstand high wind forces?  Consider looking up Polycarbonate\n\nPolycarbonate is a clear polymer that is used in bullet proof glass.  It is commonly used nowadays in homes to resist breaks.  \n\nAcrylic is also used and is more flexible but less impact resistant.\n\nBoth of these materials are available at hardware stores such as Lowes.  If you seeking profession installation, just ask about the two materials, acrylic is cheaper then polycarbonate, usually by about 1/3 the cost.  \n\nIf you are only considering windows that resist breaking due to wind force, go for acrylic, its cheaper and the wind force, even at high pressure, may bend an acrylic panel, but will not break it.   \n\nThe polycarbonate will not only resist winds, it will flex less, and given the right thickness can stop a baseball bat or ball. crow bar, and even thicker, will repel small arms fire.  \n\nBoth materials flex to some degree, but return to their original flatness immediately.

"How could you measure how much air a lung could hold?  well i know with simple instructions!\n\nTo measure how much air your lungs can hold by making a spirometer.\nInstructions: Lung Capacity\n1\nWhat You Need\n• 2 or 3 liter plastic bottle\n• Large, deep bowl or plastic dishpan\n• Water\n• Masking tape\n• Measuring cup\n• 30 cm (1 foot) long piece of flexible tubing (aquarium tubing works well)\nTo Do and Observe\n1. Vertically attach a strip of masking tape to the plastic bottle, from the\nbottom to the top of it. Fill the measuring cup with 60ml of water. Pour\nthe water into the bottle. Mark the water level on the tape. Repeat until\nyou've marked to the top of the bottle.\n2. Fill the dishpan about 10cm (4 inches) high with water.\n3. Fill the plastic bottle to the top with water, and hold your fingers over the\nmouth of the bottle so the mouth is completely covered.\n4. Invert the bottle into the pan of water. Make sure you do not remove your\nfingers until the mouth of the bottle is completely submerged. Insert one\nend of the tubing into the mouth of the bottle.\n5. Take a breath and exhale completely into the open end of the tubing.\n6. Measure how much air is now in the bottle (count the marks). To calculate\nyour lung capacity, multiply the number of marks by 60ml. If your pan is not\ntoo full of water, you can repeat without filling the bottle back up.\nWhat's Going On\n• The amount of air you can hold in your lungs is called lung capacity, and\ncan be measured with a spirometer. Blowing air from your lungs into the\nbottle forces a measurable amount of the water out of the bottle, which\nadds to the volume of water in your pan. This method of measuring uses\ndisplacement – you're displacing a volume of water with a volume of air.\nInstructions: Lung Capacity\n• Displacement is often used when something can't be measured directly. What else could you\nmeasure using displacement?\nTips\n• Check for variations in lung capacity in people of different sizes (older students,\nyou). Ask your class to look for a correlation between body size and lung\ncapacity.\n• Have each participant test for a difference between a ""normal"" breath of air and\nan ""expanded"" deeper breath.",science_mathematics

"What exactly is done to the eyes during lasik surgery?  What happens to the parts of the eyes?  Does it hurt?  It makes me so sad to hear the way that some people describe LASIK surgery!! If I was the patient and heard ""burn the eye"" or ""strap your head down"" I'd run away screaming!! No thank you!!\n\nSo, I will explain it to you the way I explain it to my patients. (Please keep in mind, this is how our center operates...every facility is a bit different.) On the day of surgery, you will be offered the opertunity to take a Vaium. It serves two purposes, take the edge off during the procedure, and help you sleep easier after the procedure. You will be escorted into the OR and will lay back on a bed. A pillow is inflated to help hold the head in the proper position, and a patch is placed over the eye that is not being treated. You are then rotated under the laser. The doctor will put a type of tape to hold down your lower lashes, and the give you plenty of numbing drops. A device is then put in to hold you eye open so you cannot blind during the procedure. The eye is then prepped to have the flap created. Typically the device that does this is called a microkeratome. During the process of creating the flap, your vision will go completely dark and you will feel some vibrations, but no pain. After the flap is created, the Dr. will fold the flap back and the laser treatment will be applied to the exposed area. It actually vaporizes areas of the cornea and changes it's shape in order to correct the vision. After the laser is done (anywhere from 15-60 seconds.) the flap is folded back into place and smooth out. The flap ends up acting as a bandage to protect the treated area. The Dr. will smooth out the cornea and healing begins almost instantly. The just before you get up, the Dr. will put a number of drops in your eyes to help begin healing, the device that was holing the eye opened is removed and you are rotated out from under the laser. That's it...about 7 minutes per eye, with only 15-60 seconds being actual laser time. When you leave your vision will be noticably better, but it will look blurry like you are opeing your eyes under water due to all the drops. Quick, easy and painless. \nI know that was lengthy, but I truly hope that it helps...\nThanks~\nLisa",science_mathematics

"Can you prove this theory? (decimal period of rational numbers)? Rational numbers as decimal fractions:\n\nWhenever you divide a whole number by a number that is not just a multiple of 2 or 5, you will receive a decimal fraction that never ends.\n\nFor certain numbers there clearly is a period: one digit for 3 or 9, two digits for 11, 33 and 99, three digits for e.g. 27 and 31, six digits for 7 or 13, etc.\n\nCharacteristic of the number of digits in the period is that there is a number which only consists of the digit 9 which is divisible by the number you divide through.\n\nI'd like to prove that there is a period for all rational numbers whose divisor isn't divisible by 2 or 5. \n\nBased on this observation, I can rephrase the theory as:\n\nFor every whole number not divisible by 2 or 5 there exists a multiple with only the digit 9.\n\n\nI'm also interested whether this observation is true for other numeric systems, e.g. hexadecimal.\n\nFor every whole number in a numeric system based on N not divisible by the prime numbers which N consists of there is a multiple Let's consider base N and a number k (the divisor)\nand take the powers of N: 1, N, N^2, N^3, ...\n\nThere's an infinity of such numbers, however their remainders when divided by k can only be smaller than k, therefore some must be repeating.\n\nLet N^a and N^b (a<b) be two powers with the same remainder, that means k | N^b-N^a.\nThen k | N^a*(N^(b-a)-1). Assuming that k is not divisible by the prime factors of N, it follows that k and N^a are mutual primes, so k | N^(b-a)-1.\n\nLet c=b-a; c>0 because a<b. Then k | N^c-1.\nBut N^c-1 is nothing else than the digit (N-1) repeated c times.\nIf you choose the minimal such number c, then (N^c-1)/k gives exactly the period of 1/k in base N.\n\n\nExample: N=10, k=7\n\npowers of N: 1, 10, 10^2=100, 10^3=1000, 10^4=10000, 10^5=100000, 10^6=1000000, ...\nremainders when divided by 7: 1, 3, 2, 6, 4, 5, 1, ...\nWe notice a repeating remainder: 1, for 1=10^0 and 10^6.

"Why does ethanol precipitate DNA?  The purpose of adding salts is to neutralize the charge on the sugar-phosphate backbone of the DNA, but ethanol's task is a little more complex than ""removing"" the water. For a precipitation, you're interested in forming ion pairs between the polyanion (DNA) and the cation (Na+, Mg++, spermidine, protamine, etc). In dilute aqueous solution, DNA and counterions like Na+ and Mg++ are more or less in the free ion form rather than the ion pair form (that is, they are surrounded by one or more layers of water molecules).\n\nWater has a high dielectric constant (e), which from Coulomb's Law tells us that the electrostatic force (F) between two ions of opposite charge is very low in water:\n\nF = (Q1 * Q2)/(e * r2)\n\nwhere Q is the charge on each ion and r is the distance between them. Adding organic solvent(read ETHANOL) *decreases* the dielectric constant of the solution. As e goes down, F goes up and *BANG*, anion and cation form an ion pair and promptly swoon out of solution.",science_mathematics

"What is cloning..? How lifes created in simple way..? What is the role of the God in creation of the life? the question arises here as how the soul enters the father’s body ? The answer is, through breathing. And how do they come out ? During the process of copulation, the internal ‘energy wave’ moves faster. Which produces heat in the body resulting in the separation of some atom and molecules (Which had entered the body of the father through breathing, taking the form of cells (sperm) in the testis) from the body and make faster movement with the increase of heat, and they head towards any where they get open space. It is like the flow of water washing away some part of the clay on course. The structure of testis of a man is made up of both negative and positive molecules. It means all atoms in it contains proton, neutron and electrons. Where as, the ovary of a woman contains only negative atoms i.e. it contains major portion of neutron and some part of electron. During copulation, getting the head the sperms move ahead to unite with the atom (ovum) of the woman which is larger in size than the sperm. Only a single sperm succeeds in uniting with the ovum. The sperm utilizes the ovum as a protective covering for itself and within the protective boundary of the ovum it get nourished. Molecules which are successful become foetus, and grow to be a boy or girl, according to their ‘sanskar’ (systematic memory). Feeding on the molecules and atoms present in the uterus, the creature (foetus) makes its growth. In the food of men and women, there are molecules and atoms, which after the digestion of the food, become the part of body. Getting food from mother, the foetus also makes growth of its body. This is the episode of that sperm which is successful.\nDuring the combining process, other remaining sperms which could not get the protection of the ovum, get destroyed fast and turn into souls. They are very delicate, for  which they can’t survive the adverse condition. Molecules get destroyed, by feeding on each other also. Souls, for a new life being mingled with air enters the body through the respiration. After passing through the lungs they mingle with the blood of the father. Then going through different metabolic process of the body they become part of testis, getting the form of a reproductive cells. There, in the body of the father, they get the feeling of heaven or hell. They remain in the testis, waiting for a new birth. After getting heat, they start flowing out breaking the bond. Like this, for a life soul, it takes years to get a new birth until it gets proper co-incidence, because one or two out of several sperms can combine with the ovum and the rest get destroyed to go back to the queue again. In the uterus, apart from the foetus, the other germs also get the feeding, but the atoms (of the foetus body) can’t eat anything. They just cohere to each other for creating the shape of the body. Like this, noting is your own in this creation of eternity and none are stranger to you either. When your own body is not actually yours, then what do you expect from others ? This is a hard fact that, if one gets the feeding, the other has to lose its life. Inside and outside the body there are several lives getting flourished and getting destroyed at eh same time. Like earth, inside the body also, there are scenes of flood, quacks, heat cold, and with this many lives are affected. The reason behind the molecules of the germs achieving body or getting a shape, is their crave for getting a life of infinity. Every atom has a desire for improving itself. That is why, their SANSKAR, in a seed form gradually improves itself to reach the level that of a human being. This is the result of a serial development that takes place.\nIn 1997, a wave was brought to the science world, when a scientist of “Rossali Institute” named lan Bilmut and his associates created a sheep named ‘Dolly’ by cloning method. Clone means ionize (without sexual intercourse). The other meaning of clone is “replica” also.

Define power.\nElectricity is the flow of electrons through a substance.\nIn the United States, electricity can be generated through coal/fossil fuel burning plants, nuclear power plants, wind(mills), and solar energy collection.\n\nIn fossil fuel and nuclear plants, they use the furnace and nuclear reactor to heat up water in order to turn a turbine, which spins around an electromagnet to generate electricity. There is much loss of energy through this process because much of the energy used to heat the water is lost through convection.  In windmills, the wind directly turns the turbine, so there is not as much loss, plus, it is a renewable resource.",science_mathematics

"Can there exist a spherical magnet? I have a query regarding the above question. If there exists a spherical magnet, then how do u locate its poles? As earth is considered to be a magnet, its poles are located at its 2 flat(assumed) surfaces with assumption that a needle passes through its poles. Can anyone help me in answering this question? In high-energy physics, medical treatments, and space detections, quadrupole field distributions and sextupole field distributions are often required over a large spherical volume. Traditionally, these fields can be generated with cylindrical magnets. In comparison with cylindrical magnets, the spherical magnets have the advantages of smaller values of inductances, lower energy storage, and less magnetic flux leakage. The basic method derives from the target field approach that has been used to solve many of the inverse electromagnetic problems. \n\nCalculation:\n\nThe geomagnetic poles or geocentric dipole, can be computed from the first three Gauss coefficients from a main field model, such as the WMM or IGRF. Based on the current WMM model, the 2005 location of the geomagnetic north pole is 79.74°N and 71.78°W and the geomagnetic south pole is 79.74°S and 108.22°E. \n\nThe magnetic poles or dip pole are computed from all the Gauss coefficients using an iterative method. Based on the current WMM model, the 2005 location of the north magnetic pole is 83.21°N and 118.32°W and the south magnetic pole is 64.53°S and 137.86°E.\n\nThe location of the center of the eccentric dipole, sometimes known as the magnetic center, computed using the first eight Gauss coefficients for 2005.0, is at approximately (r, φ´, λ) = (552 km, 22.2°N, 141.6°E). \n\nThe task of locating the principal magnetic pole by instrument is difficult for many reasons; the large area over which the dip or inclination (I) is nearly 90 degrees, the pole areas are not fixed points, but move tens to hundreds of kilometers because of daily variations and magnetic storms, and finally, the polar areas are relatively inaccessible to survey crews (map of North and South polar wander - courtesy of Dr. John Quinn, U.S. Geological Survey retired). The Geological Survey of Canada keeps track of the North Magnetic Pole, which is slowly drifting across the Canadian Arctic, by periodically carrying out magnetic surveys to redetermine the Pole's location. The most recent survey, completed in May, 2001, determined an updated position for the Pole and established that it is moving approximately northwest at 40 km per year.",science_mathematics

Biomedical engineering-\nBiomedical engineering (BME) is the application of engineering principles and techniques to the medical field. It combines the design and problem solving expertise of engineering with the medical expertise of physicians to help improve patient health care and the quality of life of healthy individuals. As a relatively new discipline, much of the work in biomedical engineering consists of research and development, covering an array of fields: bioinformatics, medical imaging, image processing, physiological signal processing, biomechanics, biomaterials and bioengineering, systems analysis, 3-D modeling, etc. Examples of concrete applications of biomedical engineering are the development and manufacture of biocompatible prostheses, medical devices, diagnostic devices and imaging equipment such as MRIs and EEGs, and pharmaceutical drugs.\nBiomedical sciences-\nHealth science is the discipline of applied science which deals with human and animal health. There are two parts to health science: the study, research, and knowledge of health and the application of that knowledge to improve health, cure diseases, and understanding how humans and animals function. Research builds primarily on the pure sciences of biology, chemistry, and physics as well as social sciences (for example medical sociology). Other fields which made an exceptionally significant contribution to the health sciences include biochemistry, biotechnology, engineering, epidemiology, genetics, nursing, pharmacology, pharmacy, public health, and medicine.

"Name the three types of seismic waves and the direction they move land?  Seismic waves are basically waves of energy caused by the sudden breaking of rock within the earth or even a massive explosion such as a volcano. They are the energy that travels through the earth and this energy will then get recorded on seismographs.\n\nThe first kind of seismic waves are known P wave or primary waves. This is the fastest kind of seismic wave. The P wave can move through solid rock and fluids, like water or the liquid layers of the earth. It pushes and pulls the rock as it moves through just like sound waves push and pull the air. If  you have ever heard a  thunder and have also heard the windows rattle at the same time this is an example. The windows rattle because the sound waves were pushing and pulling on the window glass much like P waves push and pull on rock. Usually we only feel the bump and rattle of these waves.\n\nThe second type of seismic wave is the S wave or secondary wave, which is the second wave you feel in an earthquake. An S wave is slower than a P wave and can only move through solid rock. This wave moves rock up and down, or side-to-side.\n\nThese 2 types of waves are known a body waves, next come surface waves or L waves. L waves exist because of the Earth’s surface.  They are largest at the surface and decrease in amplitude with depth. L waves are known only to move along the surface of the earth. There speeds vary depending on the material, rock or soil, forming the surface. These waves cause the surface features such as buildings to move from side-to-side.",science_mathematics

Will its travel time for the same round trip be greater, less or the same if, throughout both flights, and at the same engine speed, a constant wind blows from A to B. It will be more. Mathematically:\n\nno wind case:\n\nLet the distance from A to B = d\nAnd let the speed of the plane without wind = v\nSince distance/speed = time, in the case with no wind the time for the return trip =  d/v + d/v = 2d/v\n\nWind case:\n\nLet d,v be as above, and let the wind speed blowing from A to B = w. The planes wind-aided speed = v+w and it's wind reduced speed is v-w.

"Question  in Physics? A straight rope with mass 0 is lying on a smooth surface (no friction). Two poeple start to move from the center of the rope to different directions with the same velocities. When they get to the edges of the rope, they grasp it, and this causes them to stop moving (the rope cannot be stretched to longer length) - all the energy was gone. Another scene is that the rope is lying vertically to it's previous position, and the two poeple come from different directions horizontally and grap the two edges (they move, before the grasping in two parallel tracks). This causes them to perform a circular movement, without affecting their velocities' size (the direction is changed) - so the energy does not change. What is the physical explanation for these both scenes regarding the energy? what your calling energy is really Net Force.  or Mass x Acceleration.  \n\nin the first example, the energy wasn't gone, if you assume that the people have the same mass and were traveling at teh same velocities when they reached teh end then the net force acting on the system is 0 because the force (ma) of the first person is equeal to the force of the second person, so they cancel.  \n\nin the second example, a centrepedial force, or force towards teh center, is being applied from teh rope on the people holding it.  this causes the direction of their velocity to change.  using dot products we can find teh work done, which is change in kinetic energy.  you will find that the work done on one person is equal and opposite to the work done on the other.",science_mathematics

"does the wind that goes over the wing of a plane create a vacuum that sucks the plane into the air? i was watching the magic of flight and it showed a part where it said the wing that goes over the plane creates a kind of vacuum which sucks the plane skyward than the wind goes under the wing to keep it in the air. Air travelling above the wing is at a higher velocity than that travelling below the wing. High v = low pressure (Bernoulli's eqn) therefore the higher pressure under the wing generates a resultant force towards the lower pressure and pushes the wing upward, creating lift.",science_mathematics
"I use TMB for ELISA, dissolved in DMSO. However, it's poorly soluble at buffer pH 4.5. How do I overcome it? TMB = tetramethylbenzidine,\nDMSO = dimethylsulphoxide The pH of DMSO should be around 7.  I would dissolve the TMB at a very high concentration (100-1000 times the concentration you would like as the final) in DMSO at pH 7 and then add just a small amount of this concentrate to your sample at pH4.5.  Otherwise, you could dissolve the TMB in DMSO at pH 7 and then titrate the pH of the TMB/DMSO solution down to 4.5 using HCl.\n\nAnother possibility would be to try adding a lower concentration of TMB to your sample.

"why is venus a important planet? the planet venus is a project im doing at school i need help with this question ppl. This section summarizes advances in our understanding of Venus since 1978 and outstanding problems that require resolution by future missions. The decade following the 1978 report witnessed the acquisition of the first geophysical data relevant to the planet's interior. The Pioneer Venus radar altimeter provided a global topographic map, and radio tracking of the orbiter supplied gravity data over limited regions. In contrast to Earth, Venus's gravity and topography are highly correlated, and interpretations of the combined data may involve mantle and lithosphere dynamical processes peculiar to Venus. The Pioneer Venus magnetometer placed a strict upper limit on any internally generated global magnetic field; the implications of this for the planet's internal structure and theories of the geodynamo are profound and include the possibility that the core is completely liquid. \n\nThe Soviet Venera 15 and 16 radar missions, as well as high-resolution Earth-based radar observations, have revealed a complex tectonic history for the Venus surface. There are unique features visible in these images that could have important implications for internal processes. Although the impact crater record provides a broad constraint on surface ages, limited resolution (1 to 2 km) has prevented identification of the complete record with certainty. The Magellan mission should provide resolution sufficient to characterize the cratering history and to search for a possible relic crater population prior to climatic instability. The mission should also test hypotheses about the timing, style, and rate of surface-modification processes including erosion, possible fossil river beds, volcanic resurfacing, and perhaps plate tectonics. \n\nExperiments to determine major element composition of surface rocks were performed by seven of the Soviet Venera landers. The elemental inventories are all consistent with two types of basalts: high-potassium basalt near a suspected impact feature and tholeiitic basalts in the lowland plains, similar to ocean floor basalts on Earth. \n\nNoble gas abundances in the atmosphere of Venus were measured by the Pioneer Venus and Venera probes, but the data contain serious conflicts and are subject to profound differences of interpretation. The deuterium abundance in the atmosphere was tentatively determined from the 1978 Pioneer Venus data to be 0.016. This elevated value has been a prime driver for the argument that the planet has lost a massive amount of water over the age of the solar system, although an alternative interpretation involving comet impacts is also viable. In addition, the reported abundance of water in the atmosphere has a very peculiar altitude profile when the Pioneer Venus and Venera measurements are combined. Since the water and the deuterium abundances are key quantities in understanding the evolution of the atmosphere and the planet's surface, improved abundances and height profiles are essential. \n\nGlobal changes in the composition of the Venus atmosphere have recently been shown to occur on short time scales, on the order of months or years. Analysis indicates that the global average abundance of SO2 in the visible-part of the atmosphere decreased tenfold between 1978 and 1983, perhaps as result of the recovery of the atmosphere from a massive volcanic eruption. \n\nPioneer Venus provided important information on ionospheric and solar wind interactions, atmospheric thermal structure, zonal and meridional circulation, and planetary-scale waves and tides. The Soviet VEGA balloons collected additional information about the dynamics of the atmosphere of cloud level. \n\nSCIENTIFIC OBJECTIVES\n\nMeasurements from Pioneer Venus, Venera; VEGA, and ground-based investigations have provided a quantitative data base but have also raised fundamental issues concerning the planet's interior, surface, and atmosphere that demand further study. \n\nDetermination of the interior structure is a prim",science_mathematics

That is,\n\nF = − kx. \nWhen this holds, we say that the spring is a linear spring.\n\nFor many applications, a prismatic rod, with length L and cross sectional area A, can be treated as a linear spring.

"what are typical types of transport across a schottky barrier?  We review theoretical interpretations of Schottky barriers and Fermi-level pinning, which result when metals and other chemical species are deposited on semiconductor surfaces. Experiments indicate that these two phenomena are closely connected, so a theory of Schottky barriers must also explain Fermi-level pinning for submonolayer coverages of both metallic and nonmetallic species. Proposed mechanisms include the following: (a) Intrinsic surface states. For GaAs and several other materials, there are no intrinsic surface states within the band gap; GaP, e.g., does have surface states in the gap, but they are not at the correct energy to explain Schottky barrier formation. (b)Metal-induced gap states. These states, which require a thick metal overlayer, cannot explain Fermi-level pinning at submonolayer metallic coverages. They also cannot explain why a single semiconductor (n-type InP) exhibits two distinct Schottky barrier heights. Furthermore, they cannot explain why the Schottky barrier persists when there is an oxide layer between semiconductor and metal. Metal-induced states can in principle give rise to Schottky barriers at defect-free interfaces, but they fail to explain much of the existing experimental data for III–V semiconductors and Si. (c) The classic Schottky model. This model is not in agreement with experiment for III–V and Group IV semiconductors, but does appear to account for the measurements involving nonreactive metals on GaSe–a layered material expected to be relatively free of defects. (d) The Spicer defect model. This phenomenological model, now supported by microscopic theoretical studies, appears to account for many of the observations regarding Schottky barrier and Fermi-level pinning. We review our theoretical investigations within the framework of the defect model, which provide a satisfactory explanation of the principal observations for both III–V and Group IV semiconductors. We conclude that the levels responsible for Schottky barriers and Fermi-level pinning arise from two sources: (1) bulk-derived deep levels (e.g., the deep donor level for the antisite defect AsGa, which persists when this defect is present at the surface, but which is shifted in energy), and (2) dangling-bond deep levels (which are also shifted in energy according to the environment of the dangling bond). Most of the observed Schottky barriers—for both III–V and Group IV semiconductors—are attributed to dangling bon",science_mathematics

If I were doing it, I would position the projector directly above the car and project down through the windshield onto the dashboard. \n\nIn practical terms, you're going to find that this is quite difficult to make work, for the following reasons: \n\n(1) Dashboards are usually a dark color, which makes for a lousy projection screen. You'll need an extremely bright projector to make up for that. You'll also need extra brightness to make up for the (large!) amount of light lost due to reflection off the windshield itself, before the light even gets to the dashboard. Generally, the brighter the projector, the more expensive. Expect to pay in the five- or even six-figure range.\n(2) Cars are different sizes, which means that the distance from the projection lens to the dashboard will be different in a Tahoe than in a Corolla. That means that you will need to figure out a system that can focus differently for different cars.\n(3) Even knowing the throw distance to the dashboard, the dashboard is not flat. That means that parts of the image will not be in focus no matter what you do.",science_mathematics

According to the Merck Index, 12th edition, the LD50, the lethal dose for 50% of tested rats, is 42 milligrams per kilogram of body weight.

For oral consumption, the LD50 for rats is 1270 mg/kg and 730 mg/kg for males and females, respectively, equivalent to the THC in about a pound of 15% THC cannabis.

"How and why does your face turn red when your embrassed? How and why does your face turn red when your embrassed? There is evidence that the blushing region is anatomically different in structure. The facial skin, for example, has more capillary loops per square millimeter and generally more vessels per unit volume than other skin areas. In addition, blood vessels of the cheek are wider in diameter, are nearer the surface, and visibility is less diminished by tissue fluid. These specific characteristics of the architecture of the facial vessels led Wilkin in an overview of possible causes of facial flushing to the following conclusion: ""[...] increased capacity and greater visibility can account for the limited distribution of flushing"" (Wilkin. 1988).\n\nEvidence for special vasodilation mechanisms was reported by Mellander and his colleagues (Mellander, Andersson, Afzelius, & Hellstrand. 1982). They studied buccal segments of the human facial veins in vitro. Unlike veins from other areas of the skin, facial veins responded with an active myogenic contraction to passive stretch and were therefore able to develop an intrinsic basal tone. Additionally Mellander et al. showed that the veins in this specific area were also supplied with beta-adrenoceptors in addition to the common alpha-adrenoceptors. These beta-adrenoceptors could exert a dilator mechanism on the above-described basal tone of the facial cutaneous venous plexus. Mellander and his colleagues propose that this mechanism is involved in emotional blushing. Drummond has partially confirmed this effect by pharmacological blocking experiments (Drummond. 1997). In a number of trials, he blocked both alpha-adrenergic receptors (with phentolamine) and beta-adrenergic receptors (with propranolol introduced transcutaneously by iontophoresis). Blushing was measured at the forehead using a dual channel laser Doppler flowmeter. Subjects were undergraduate students divided into frequent and infrequent blushers according to self-report. Their mean age was 22.9 years, which is especially favorable for assessing blushing, since young subjects are more likely to blush and blush more intensively. The subjects underwent several procedures, one of which was designed to produce blushing. Alpha-adrenergic blockade with phentolamine had no influence on the amount of blushing in frequent or in infrequent blushers, indicating that release of sympathetic vasoconstrictor tone does not substantially influence blushing. This result was expected since vasoconstrictor tone in the facial area is known to be generally low (van der Meer. 1985). Beta-adrenergic blockade with propranolol on the other hand decreased blushing in both frequent and infrequent blushers. However, despite complete blockade, blood flow still increased substantially during the embarrassment and blushing inducing procedure. Additional vasodilator mechanisms must therefore be involved. So far, no specific mechanism has been suggested.",science_mathematics

"What is the mist cooling? If there is any picture with dimensions or details Mist cooling is simply introducing an atomized spray of water into an airstream to cool the air.   As the water droplets vaporize and dissolve in the air, they remove heat energy from the air, leaving the air slightly cooler.\n\nThese systems are most effective in dry heat climates, where the relative humidity is low.  The water can evaporate much more quickly, removing more heat.\n\nThe lowest temperature that can be conceivably reached (provided that the system were 100% efficient) is the dewpoint temperature, also known as the wet-bulb temperature.  If the air were cooled to this temperature, its relative humidity would be 100% and it would be at maximum moisture saturation.  So, in most cases, these coolers can only reduce temperatures to 60 or 70 degrees under normal conditions, unless you're in a desert or other arid region.\n\nMost mist coolers are smaller, portable systems that use a common fan with several nozzles in front of it that produce a very fine mist spray of water.\n\nSmaller systems are also available for cooling milling work in tooling manufacturing.  These systems typically have an additive in the water supply to reduce the oxidation effects of the water.",science_mathematics

"hi ppl in what year and where was the first crop circle investigated ? results can be found on History chanel and it wasn't in the UK THIS IS ALL I FOUND\n\n\nCrop Circle Mysteries  \n\n \n\nCrop Circles and Earth Energies\n\n\nCrop circles are unexplained patterns that are found in fields, over tree-tops, and in ice and snow. They are mostly often found in wheat or corn fields, but have also been found in oat, rape (canola), and barley. \n\nThey are a world wide phenomena, highlighted in England, the Netherlands, the United States, and Australia. Crop circles have not as yet been reported in China and South Africa. \n\nTheir sudden appearance may go unreported unless spotted by an airplane flying overhead or someone familiar with the concept of the formations. I am quite sure that crop formations are as old as the planet itself. \n\n\nThe earliest known formation was in 1647 in England, from which a carving of the current day theory on how it was created can be seen. \n\n \n\nThe crop circle phenomenon was first reported during modern times in 1972 when two witnesses, Arthur Shuttlewood and Bryce Bond, sat on the slope of Star Hill near Warminster, England, hoping to catch a glimpse of the strange unidentifyed flying craft that had made this part of England a UFO Mecca for almost a decade. But what they witnessed on that moonlit night was something more extraordinary--a hundred feet away they saw an imprint take shape, a large circular area of plants that collapsed within twenty seconds. \n\nCrop formations are often accompanied by sightings of unusual lights and structured craft beaming shafts of light onto the field the night before. Most crop formations are created at night between the hours of 11 PM - 4 AM. There have been daylight formations also. \n\n\n\nVery often crop formations appear where powerful ley lines intersect-- or the Earth's magnetic energy lines. This is often at the same place where megalithic sites such as Stonehenge are found. Dowsing can be done within the formations after the crop has been plowed when there are no longer traces of physical evidence. \n\nThe patterns often can be equated to Creation, Celestial Bodies, the Chakras, or Sacred Geometry. \n\n\n\nTo date, thousands of crop formations have been reported and investigated worldwide. In areas where the significance of the patterns is not known thousands of others have not been recorded but have been created. \n\n\n\n\nTheories about the Creation of the Formations\nHarmonics resonance of the planetary grids - collective unconscious \nPlasma Beings / Crafts\nExtraterrestrials\nEarth Energies - Gaia theories based on the Ley Lines of the Earth\nNature Spirits\nWhirlwind or Friction Generated Plasma Vortexes\nHoaxed by humans \nCreated by a satellite apparatus just above the earth. \n \n\nFrom Ian Christopher Email of the Mariposa-Pacific \nResearch Institute on the hidden meaning behind the Crop Circles.\n""Based on all available data, including field research, scientific\nanalysis and confidential high level, inside sources, and many witness experiences in the field, we are lead to conclude the following regarding the hidden meaning behind the crop circle phenomenon:\n\n""There is no single message to look for or decipher.  \nThe symbols are holograms not unlike the Egyptian Hieroglyphs.

"If black holes exist as described then how fast would they move in the Universe?  I found this interesting article about an ancient black hole scientists have located near our solar system.  They determined the exact route and speed at which this monster has been traveling.\n\nConducting a bit of astronomical archaeology, researchers have dug up 43-year-old photographic evidence of an ancient black hole and used the information to learn that the object has been wandering at high speed on an odd, looping path through the Milky Way Galaxy for 7 billion years.\n\nThe study, discussed in the Sept. 13 issue of the journal Nature, represents the first measure of a black hole's movement through space, said researchers involved in the work.\n\nThe object's travels take it above and below the main plane of the galaxy, where the Sun and most other stars reside and orbit around the galactic center in relatively orderly fashion. The wayward black hole zooms along at 90 miles per second (145 kilometers per second) relative to the Earth, currently carving an arc up and over our solar system.\n\nIn pinning down the vagabond's trajectory and piecing together a picture of its past, researchers say they are adding pages to at least one chapter in the book that explains how the galaxy formed. \n\nThe object is estimated to have been around more than 2 billion years before our Sun was born, a time when the Milky Way was a toddler of a galaxy.\n\n""We believe that hundreds of thousands of very massive stars formed early in the history of our Galaxy, but this is the first black hole remnant of one of those huge primeval stars that we've found,"" said lead researcher Felix Mirabel, an astrophysicist at the Institute for Astronomy and Space Physics of Argentina and the French Atomic Energy Commission.\n\nAccording to what I read, I would have to assume that the rate and speed at which a black hole travels has much to do with its' size.\n\nI would recommend you finish reading the article.

"What is the ""cultural context"" and how does it influence development? This is dealing with developmental psychology. At birth, the brain has many synapses (connection points between neurons, where a neorutransmitter is released from one cell to signal the next).  The synapses are generated in utero by mechanisms that are primarily genetic, and they don't manage to do much to make the brain useful initially.  As a child develops, the experiences of life--which can be as simple as moving a muscle and feeling which appendage moves, or as comlex as trying to ascertain emotion from facial expression--synapses are strengthened or weakened (or even eliminated) in such ways as to make the connections that exist meaningful.  By this, I mean to say that the connections must work to potentiate a relevant response to a given stimulus.\n\nAs a stimulus-response mechanism, the brain is very complicated.  A stiulus can be internal from the brain, and a response can be internal to the brain, in terms of a cognition (thought) being either a stimulus or a response in and of itself.\n\nCultural context will shape the sorts of stimuli encountered and affect the way that the brain wires itself.  One of the most obvious ways is in the recognition of phonemes, or sounds that comprise a language.  Even at a very young agae, prior to the age necessary to speak, the brain is picking up cues from conversations as to what sorts of sounds are considered equal.  A given letter pronounced by one person might be very different from that pronounced by another person, but the brain will learn to regard them as the same.  A noted example of this is the letters L and R in English, which are often indistinguishable to Japanese speakers.  Others include things like the differences between Arabic single and double letters, which has no direct equivalent in English.\n\nThe cultural context will also determine many other things, particularly aesthetics.  Foods are seen as tasty or repulsive on a largely cultural basis.  Music that might be dissonant or cacophonic to some might be harmonious or rhythmic to others.\n\nThere are also the ethical differences.  For some, even uttering the wrong word might be anathema, while for others a word is just a word.  Taboos and sins will shape the brain to avoid some behaviors, while differences in virtues will predispose the mind to seek out other behaviors.",science_mathematics

"How can global warming be reversed?  Can global warming be reversed? It has been argued that so-called clean technology may be the answer. Scrubbing flue gases from power stations will certainly remove a considerable amount of sulphur dioxide and particulate matter, but nothing can remove carbon dioxide from the environment except to return it to a form of carbon, which would consume more energy than that usefully released during combustion. The same arguments apply to ""clean"" car engines. The reality is that international capitalism is inextricably linked to cheap oil-based technology and as George W. Bush has amply demonstrated, is incapable, at least for the foreseeable future, of dealing with the problem of global warming. Unfortunately time is not on our side. Fossil and ice core records indicate that the current level of atmospheric CO2 is associated with considerably higher global temperatures than we are currently experiencing. The latest IPCC report also predicts a long term continuation of global warming even if CO2 emissions ceased immediately. We are likely to be in a time lag where the effects of current CO2 levels have not yet fully materialised.",science_mathematics
"Why do kettles go quite when they come to the boil? Why are kettles noisy as they come to the boil and then go quiet when they are boiling? ""...it's caused by cavitation, which is a high-tech way of saying bubbles form and then they pop. When you heat water on the stove, the layer at the bottom is the first to boil, meaning it turns into a gas. The water vapor collects into bubbles, which rise toward the surface, passing through cooler water en route. The lower temperature causes the vapor to recondense into liquid and the bubbles collapse, making a noise. This gets gradually louder, as bubble production increases, until the water is so uniformly hot that the bubbles make it to the top without popping. At this point the noise diminishes. But it takes a moment before the vapor pressure builds up sufficiently in the top of the kettle to make it start whistling. That's why you get a brief period of calm before the steam--an incredibly feeble play on words, but a perfectly adequate description of the event.""",science_mathematics

"Which graphs have a vertex of (0,0)? Explain how you know.? The graphs are y=3x(squared)-4, y=-2x(squared), y=5x(squared)\nWhen i mean explain how I mean  where in the equation does it tell you that it will have a vertex of (0,0)? Please help me. The first two answers are completely wrong. The fact that (0, 0) satisfies the equation only means (0, 0) is a point on the parabola, not that it is also the vertex of the parabola. For example, plugging (0, 0) into y = (x - 1)^2 - 1 yields a true equation because the point is on the graph, but the vertex of the parabola is the point (1, -1)!\n\nRemember that if you have a function y = f(x), then y = f(x - k) for some constant k is just the graph of f(x) shifted k units to the right (see what happens to f(k) and f(0) when you subtract k from the argument).\nSimilarly y = f(x) + j will be the graph of f(x) shifted upwards by j units.\nNow, a parabola with vertex at the origin has function f(x) = hx^2 for some scaling constant h. The forms we are looking for are then y = h(x - k)^2 + j where the vertex will have been moved to (k, j). Thus, we just need to adjust our equations to the form above and read (k, j) off of them.\nFor example, your first equation is y = 3x^2 - 4. Adjusted to the form above, we get y = 3(x - 0)^2 + (-4). Thus (k, j) = (0, -4), so this graph's vertex is not at the origin.",science_mathematics

"how are thunderstorms and tornadoes related? how are thunderstorms and tornadoes alike Thunderstorms are often caused by the same conditions that tornadoes need to form. When there is a temperature inversion, where a mass of hot air is trapped under a mass of cold air, the hot air wants to rise and the cold air wants to sink. When something called a 'discontinuity' or 'catastrophe' occurs, the air masses begin to slip and spiral past one another, with the hot air rising and the cold air sinking. When the whirling air reaches the ground, it sucks up everything in its path.  Thunderstorms often happen when hot and old air masses collide. Friction between the moving air masses causes sparks of static electricity (lightning) and air currents in the clouds sometimes lift ice particles up and down over and over again so that they pick up more droplets of moisture which freeze on them and that is how hailstones grow. When the air masses collide, one can start to ride up over the other one, leading to the temperature inversion mentioned earlier.",science_mathematics

"why freon is used as refrigerant?  In Depth\n\nDuring the mid-twentieth century, Freon® was little appreciated but indispensable. The DuPont-produced gas made widespread use of refrigerators and air conditioners possible and served as propellant in aerosol sprays of all types. Up to the 1920s, most commonly used refrigerants were exceedingly hazardous substances. Late in the decade, two scientists doing research for General Motors’ (GM) Frigidaire subsidiary, developed an inert, nontoxic, and odorless replacement chlorofluorocarbon gas (CFC) called Freon® . GM asked DuPont to develop the product on a large scale and a plant was built at Deepwater, New Jersey, in 1930. In their work with the substance, DuPont scientists discovered that Freon® also made an effective aerosol propellant. Related CFCs also proved effective as degreasing agents and as the basis for Teflon® , a remarkably durable and inert plastic. Freon® products were produced and marketed through a joint DuPont-GM venture called Kinetic Chemicals Company up to 1949 when the operations came under control of the Organic Chemicals Department.\n\nDemand for Freon® refrigerants and propellants continued to grow until the 1970s when scientific studies indicated that CFCs were depleting the ozone layer that shielded the earth from harmful ultraviolet radiation. During the 1980s DuPont began developing more environmentally friendly hydroflourocarbons, eventually marketed as Suva® refrigerants and Dymel® propellants. During the 1980s, federal regulatory agencies banned the use of chlorofluorocarbons and DuPont began phasing out production, producing its last CFCs in the developed countries in 1995. The difficulties faced by American producers and consumers alike in curtailing their use of Freon® were a testament to its profound impact on postwar life.",science_mathematics

"Cause and effect of continued lost of biological diversity?  Do you mean in humans? Loss of biological diversity in humans is caused in part by genetic drift. Genetic drift is a random loss of genetic material, particularly in smaller populations. Genetic drift doesn't seem to occur in larger populations because there's no selective mating, and alleles are getting thrown around all the time. I heard somewhere that within the next 200 years or so, blondes will disappear because it is a recessive allele. I think that's bull considering the large amount of people with blonde hair, and heterozygous brunettes, but no matter.\n\nThe effect of loss of biological diversity... well I guess that depends. In selective breeding of dogs, breeders notice that they can get good results within the first few generations. For example, if they want really big dobermans, they'll mate two big dobermans, and then mate their largest offspring with other large dogs. After several generations, they'll notice that they can't make the dogs any larger because there's no more variation in size. Because they've been artificially selected, the ""big"" genes are all that's left, and there's no chance for ""bigger"" genes because there's no gene flow. (Gene flow is just the introduction of new genes into a population)\n\nI hope that helped, it was a little messy and abbreviated because the concept is very complex.",science_mathematics

"Why exactly does sugar makesome people ""hyper""? Sugar is really a pretty simple molecule.  What exactly is it that produces the effect of hyperness in some people? \n\n I never see people with diabetes or blood sugar problems act ""hyper"", it's usually just in young children (especially those prone to ADD / ADHD) A sudden increase in blood glucose concentration leads to the release of a specific hormone in the human body: insulin. Insulin is released to reduce the concentration of sugar in the blood. In order to do this, it promotes muscular uptake of sugar, by promoting muscular activity.  \n\nThis is why people with diabetes do not show this phenomenon. Type I diabetes patients do not secrete insulin (hence the need for insulin shots).

You next add another antibody specific for Hep C which has a covalently attached enzyme (commonly beta galactosidase). If the Hep C antigen is present, the new antibody will bind as well.

The principles of thermodynamics are of fundamental importance to all branches of science and engineering.\n\nA central concept of thermodynamics is that of the macroscopic system, defined as a geometrically isolable piece of matter in coexistence with an infinite, unperturbable environment. The state of a macroscopic system in equilibrium can be described in terms of such measurable properties as temperature, pressure, and volume, which are known as thermodynamic variables. Many other variables (such as density, specific heat, compressibility, and the coefficient of thermal expansion) can be identified and correlated, to produce a more complete description of an object and its relationship to its environment.\n\nWhen a macroscopic system moves from one state of equilibrium to another, a thermodynamic process is said to take place. Some processes are reversible and others are irreversible. The laws of thermodynamics, discovered in the 19th century through painstaking experiment, govern the nature of all thermodynamic processes and place limits on them.",science_mathematics

"What is the temperature of steam(fresh water)compared to the temperature of steam from salt water? Since the boiling point of salt water is higher than the boiling point of salt water, therefore my guess is that the temperature of salt water steam is higher than fresh water steam. The highest temperature water in liquid form can reach is the boiling point.  At this point the water will change from a liquid phase to a gas.  For pure water, this initial temperature is 100 deg Celcius.  For salt water, the  water will reach about 100.5 deg before turning into a gas.  Once it becomes a gas it usually escapes direct contact from the heat source and cools and condenses back into a liquid form that is suspended in the air in the form of tiny droplets (this is the steam that you see).  Since any salt will remain behind as the liquid boils into a gas, the gaseous water from both sources will condense back into the steam that you see at 100 degrees.  So I guess you could say that the initial temperature of boiling water from salt water is slightly higher but once it becomes the white misty steam that you see, the two are basically the same temperature.",science_mathematics

I guess you would have to go to the source on this one. . \n\nWhich would probably be Mexican Diamond miners from the south east.\n\nKnown for their unsurpassed consumption of refried beans, This particular group of miners has been credited as the sole keeper of a centuries old formula to produce sparkling water. . (a formula imitated by evian, after the largest industrial espionage scandal of the 1920s Involving bootleg moonshine, and messenger pigeons.)\n\nWhile it is a well known fact that refried beans and liquefied diamonds account for 99.97% of the ingredients in sparkling water the remaining 0.03% ""secret ingredient"" is said to be guarded in adherence to the strictest security protocol by a person known as MAUSSAN.\n\nThere seems to exist a series of clues, (that could baffle even the best of cryptologists) as to where the original formula is actually hidden.

"&#92;GRAVITY //  How does it works?  Okay. Everything that has mass has gravity. You and I have our own innate gravity. So does your pencil, your computer, the air you breathe. \n\nIf you think of space-time (see Einstein) as the surface of a huge trampoline on which everything sits, then mass sits on top of that trampoline. But if you put a bowling ball on a trampoline, it puckers the surface and smaller things are drawn towards it, and it is drawn towards the smaller thing, if only a little bit. Similarly, if you roll a marble around the bowling ball, it will circle many times before it finally crashes into the bowling ball. (That how orbiting works.)\n\nThis is simplified, of course, but it helps to understand the concepts. If you are interested in the subject, I would recommend reading Billions and Billions by Carl Sagan.\n\nGood Luck!",science_mathematics

"Define matter,mass,particle,wave,space,atom,element,molecule,antimatter? I know only mathematics where we start with axioms and then only we can define anything. In physics,what is the starting point?Are there basic axioms? The definations wanted by you are given below-\n\nIn physics, matter is commonly defined as the substance of which physical objects are composed, not counting the contribution of various energy or force-fields, which are not usually considered to be matter per se (though they may contribute to the mass of objects). Matter constitutes much of the observable universe, although again, light is not ordinarily considered matter. Unfortunately, for scientific purposes, ""matter"" is somewhat loosely defined.\n\nMass is a property of a physical object that quantifies the amount of matter and energy it is equivalent to. Mass is a central concept of classical mechanics and related subjects, and there are several forms of mass within the framework of relativistic kinematics (see mass in special relativity and mass in General Relativity). In the theory of relativity, the quantity invariant mass, which in concept is close to the classical idea of mass, does not vary between single observers in different reference frames.\n\nAn elementary particle is a particle with no measurable internal structure, that is, it is not a composite of other particles. They are the fundamental objects of quantum field theory. Elementary particles can be classified according to their spin, with fermions having half-integer spin and bosons integer spin.\n\nSpace has been an interest for philosophers and scientists for much of human history. The term is used somewhat differently in different fields of study, hence it is difficult to provide an uncontroversial and clear definition outside of specific defined contexts. Disagreement also exists on whether space itself can be measured or is part of the measuring system. (See Space in philosophy.) Many fields use an operational definition in which the units of measurement are defined, but not space itself.\n\nIn chemistry and physics, an atom (Greek  átomos meaning ""indivisible"") is the smallest particle of a chemical element that retains its chemical properties. \n\nA chemical element, often called simply an element, is a substance that cannot be decomposed or transformed into other chemical substances by ordinary chemical processes. All matter consists of these elements and as of 2006, 117 unique elements have been discovered or artificially created. The smallest particle of such an element is an atom, which consists of electrons centered about a nucleus of protons and neutrons.\n\nIn chemistry, a molecule is an aggregate of two or more atoms in a definite arrangement held together by chemical bonds. Chemical substances are not infinitely divisible into smaller fractions of the same substance: a molecule is generally considered the smallest particle of a pure substance that still retains its composition and chemical properties. Certain pure substances (e.g., metals, molten salts, crystals, etc.) are best understood as being composed of networks or aggregates of atoms or ions instead of molecular units.\n\nIn particle physics, antimatter extends the concept of the antiparticle to matter, wherein if a particle and its antiparticle come into contact with each other, the two annihilate —that is, they may both be converted into other particles with equal energy in accordance with Einstein's equation E = mc2. This gives rise to high-energy photons (gamma rays) or other particle–antiparticle pairs-.",science_mathematics

In fact, a raindrop is a lens.  Every lens has a focal length based on its shape and material and when objects within the focal length, they are magnified.  Raindrops, however, have a very short focal length so anything you see through them will likely be beyond the focal length.  Objects beyond the focal length are not necessarily magnified, and in fact they are flipped.  It's much easier to understand with a ray tracing diagram.

"why doesnt water burn? h2o has a stable oxygen atom, when heated gets converted to steam. hydrogen gas burns so why doesnt steam? VTNomad is right.  Hydrogen gas is H:H (two hydrogen atoms sharing a covalent bond) and molecular oxygen is O=O (two oxygen atoms sharing two covalent bonds).\n\nOxidation results from electronegativity, or the affinity of atoms for electrons.  Oxygen is very electronegative, which means it really, really wants to have it's own electrons, and it hates to share them (metaphorically speaking, of course).  Hydrogen is not very electronegative, and its pretty content to walk around as a positive ion with no electrons at all.  It is the weakling on the school playground who will get beaten up and have its electrons stolen by the big kids, like oxygen and chlorine.\n\nTwo oxygen atons don't like having to share electrons, but they can't take them from one another.  But if an oxygen molecule sees two hydrogen molecules, then the two oxygen atoms will part ways, and each will beat up the hydrogen weakling and take both of its electrons.  The ""fight"" that ensues is fire, where the rapid loss of energy (O=O bonds and H-H bonds have a lot of energy, while H-O-H bonds are low in energy) becomes heat and light, aka fire.\n\nAn oxygen atom, though it likes electrons, will have a negative charge of -2 if it has the eight total electrons needed for Nobel configuration.  Likewise, Hydrogen will have a positive charge if denied its electrons.  So oxygen will let two little hydrogens tag along, and the H2O molecule is charge neutral.  But in water, the electrons are almost always around the oxygen, while the hydgrogen has very little chance of any electrons being around it for very long.  These bonds are low energy.\n\nOther things that burn--coal, gas, methane--these are things where carbon shares electrons with either more carbon or with hydrogen.  O2 will come along and steal electrons.  But O2 can't steal electrons from water, because the oxygen atom in water is just as tough (electronegative) as the oxygen in O2, so it won't win that fight.  But oxygen can take electrons from carbon (giving CO2, or carbon dioxide) or hydrogen, and it does.",science_mathematics

"What is the scientific and common name for Tracheophytes?  Scientific names is Tracheophyta \n\n\nCommon names: Vascular plants include the ferns, clubmosses, horsetails, flowering plants, conifers and other gymnosperms\n\nThe vascular plants are plants in the Kingdom Plantae (also called Viridiplantae) that have specialized tissues for conducting water. Vascular plants include the ferns, clubmosses, horsetails, flowering plants, conifers and other gymnosperms. Scientific names are Tracheophyta and Tracheobionta, but neither is very widely used. Nonvascular plants include both earlier-derived lineages in Plantae (mosses, hornworts, and liverworts) and members of other kingdoms (the various algae).\n\nThe vascular plants are set apart in two important ways:\n\nVascular plants have water-carrying tissues, enabling the plants to evolve to a larger size. Non-vascular plants lack these and are restricted to relatively small sizes. \nIn vascular plants, the principal generation phase is the sporophyte, which is diploid with two sets of chromosomes per cell. In non-vascular plants, the principal generation phase is often the gametophyte, which is haploid with one set of chromosomes per cell. See also alternation of generations. \nWater transport happens in either xylem or phloem: xylem carries water and inorganic solutes upward toward the leaves from the roots, while phloem carries organic solutes throughout the plant.\n\n[edit]\nMembers\nSpore-bearing vascular plants \nEquisetophyta ~ horsetails \nLycopodiophyta ~ clubmosses, spikemosses, quillworts \nPsilotophyta ~ whisk-ferns \nPteridophyta~ ferns \nSeed-bearing vascular plants - Superdivision Spermatophyta \nPinophyta ~ conifers \nCycadophyta ~ cycads \nGinkgophyta ~ ginkgoes \nGnetophyta ~ gnetophytes \nMagnoliophyta ~ flowering plants \n\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracheophyte",science_mathematics
"How do you feel about Nuclear power plants as a source of energy? I have yet to make up my mind on Nuclear Energy, I would just like to see how you feel about it. I know some facts, but I would like to gain more knowlege. Also what are your ideas on Cold Fission?\nAlso if you could give you age that would be helpful, by all means you do not have to.  -Thank you for your time. The greatest technological challenge of the 21st century is to meet energy demand in an environmentally sustainable way.  Nuclear energy is a carbon free energy; however, current fission technology leaves a deadly legacy - radioactive waste that is toxic for tens of thousands of years.  To put the energy demands of humans in perspective with nuclear energy, please see the lecture by Nate Lewis (California Institute of Technology).  In 2006, humans are consuming energy at a rate of about 14TW (14 trillion watts).  Using current technology, in order to generate 10TW of energy, we would have to build a new reactor every single day for the next 50 years.  This would be a monumental effort in stupidity and futility.  Furthermore, this would not meet growing energy demand, which is predicted to be ~28TW in the year 2050.  The clearest alternatives are wind energy and solar energy.  Practically, wind energy used globally can potentially provide ~2TW energy, meaning that solar energy is going to be our primary energy source.  The energy that strikes the Earth in 1 hour as sunlight is enough to provide humanity's energy needs for 1 year (~14TW).  However, this energy is diffuse, and we still need to develop low cost, efficient methods to convert solar energy to fuels and electricity. Research is progressing rapidly in this topic.  The world needs to committ massive resources to this right now.  \n\nThe second part of your question relates to cold fusion.  Interestingly, fusion is the source of sunlight, so using solar energy, is in a way, using fusion energy (we don't have to worry about the problems of containment and generating fusion pressures and temperatures).  There are a few research projects around the world that are working on finding useful methods for controlling fusion reactions for energy.  Perhaps the most well known involves a giant room with thousands of high energy lasers that are focused at a pelletized source of fusionable material.  In this scheme, the energy input from the lasers initiates fusion.  This technology is promising, but is far from being economical.  Research efforts should continue.",science_mathematics

"how do you calculate relative frequency?  In a series of observations, or trials, the relative frequency of occurrence of an event E is calculated as the number of times the event E happened over the total number of observations made. The relative frequency density of occurrence of an event is the relative frequency of E divided by the size of the bin used to classify E.\n\nIn biology, Relative Frequency is the occurance of a single gene in a specific species that makes up a gene pool.\n\nThe limiting relative frequency of an event over a long series of trials is the conceptual foundation of the frequency interpretation of probability. In this framework, it is assumed that as the length of the series increases without bound, the fraction of the experiments in which we observe the event will stabilize. This interpretation is often contrasted with Bayesian probability.\n\nTo calculate the frequency of an event, the number of occurrences of the event within a fixed time interval are counted, and then divided by the length of the time interval.\n\nIn SI units, the result is measured in hertz (Hz), named after the German physicist Heinrich Rudolf Hertz. 1 Hz means that an event repeats once per second, 2 Hz is twice per second, and so on. This unit was originally called a cycle per second (cps), which is still used sometimes. Other units that are used to measure frequency include revolutions per minute (rpm) and radians per second (rad/s). Heart rate and musical tempo are measured in beats per minute (BPM).\n\nAn alternative method to calculate frequency is to measure the time between two consecutive occurrences of the event (the period) and then compute the frequency as the reciprocal of this time:\n\n \nwhere T is the period. A more accurate measurement takes many cycles into account and averages the period between each.",science_mathematics

[edit] Atmospheric convection\nIn the case of Earth's atmosphere, solar radiation heats the Earth's surface, and this heat is then transferred to the air by convection. When a layer of air receives enough heat from the Earth's surface, it expands, becomes less dense and is pushed upward by buoyancy. Colder, heavier air sinks under it and is then warmed, expands, and rises. The warm rising air cools as it reaches the higher, cooler regions of the atmosphere and becomes denser. Since it cannot sink through the rising air beneath it, it moves laterally and then begins to sink. When it reaches the surface again it is heated, and is drawn back into the original rising column.\nSo the answer is D",science_mathematics
"Radio waves - How do they work? Explain in as much detail as possible how the audio sound from the station is transported across the country and played on radios. The main concept to understand is that of a carrier wave.  The radio wave is that.  A radio wave is electro-magnetic radiation, which, unlike other waves, is not a vibration within a medium, like sound waves for example, which are the propagation of alternating high and low pressure within the air, or other fluid media.  Electro-magnetic waves are a self propagating electro-magnetic effect which can travel even in a vacuum.  Electro-magnetic radiation is a pulsing stream of energy where the pulses are at a constant frequency.  What we perceive as different phenomenon are in fact the same electromagnetic radiation but at different frequencies.  Microwaves, Radio, Ultra-violet, Visible Light, and Infra-red, are all electro-magnetic radiation moving down the scale from high to low frequency.\n\nThe radio transmitter sends out radio waves at a specific frequency or band of frequencies.  The aerial of the receiver develops tiny electric currents in it as the radio wave flows past it.  These are pulsing currents at the same frequency as the radio wave, but these pulses are not in themselves the content of speech or music.  This content, or signal, is carried in the wave, hence the concept of the carrier wave.\n\nIt is easier to understand Amplitude Modulation or AM radio so I will restrict myself to that.  If you imagine a radio wave as a very long string with the pulses like beads on it, all spaced at precise intervals, then imagine that the beads slowly getter bigger and smaller along its length.  Each bead is a packet of energy in the wave and all occur at the same frequency, but where the beads get bigger there is more energy in the packet.  It only takes a little more imagination now to see how the pattern of a sound wave can be represented by the bulging out of the beads, and their getting smaller.  This is called the amplitude.\n\nLooking at it in practical terms, at the transmitter end sound is converted in the microphone into a corresponding pattern of changes in the current flowing through the microphone.  That is your signal.  That signal which is at a low electrical power, is used to create the same pattern but in a circuit of much higher electrical power - that is what an amplifier does.  The device used to transfer the pattern is called a transistor, which uses the low powered circuit to control the flow in the high powered circuit.\n\nThe amplified signal is fed to the transmitter aerial, so now that pattern of electrical energy, identical to the pattern of the sound picked up by the microphone, comes out of the aerial as radio waves, with the pattern held in the varying amplitude of the radio wave.\n\nNow comes a trick to follow.  If there are thousands of transmitters all radiating radio waves all over the place, how come your radio only picks up the one signal.  This is where the tuner comes in.  The principle of radio tuning depends on the opposite properties of coils and capacitors.  I don't know if you know what these are, but it doesn't matter if you don't.  Both of these devices have a special kind of resistance to electricity known as impedance.  Impedance only operates where the current is varying.  The voltages and currents in our radio Ariel will be varying at exactly the same frequency as each radio wave it is exposed to, so if we pass that current through either a coil or a capacitor there will be an impedance in the circuit.  Now the impedance of the coil increases as the frequency gets higher and the impedance of the capacitor gets higher as the frequency gets lower.  An AM tuning circuit simply passes the signal current through both a coil and a capacitor at the same time, and the capacitor is a mechanically variable one, so by turning a knob you can increase or decrease the capacitance.  The trick here is that as the capacitance changes the circuit will show least impedance to a specific frequency compared with all the others, so provided the frequencies are not too close, as the law requ",science_mathematics

"You know that illusion when you look at something spinning really fast..? I was in bed this morning and I was watching my ceiling fan spin and after starring at it for a couple of seconds it appeared to slow down and then it even looked like it went the opposite direction. It was trippy. You often get this illusion when you look at spinning car wheels. What causes this? Temporal aliasing\n\nTemporal aliasing is the term applied to a visual phenomenon also known as the ""stroboscopic effect"". It also accounts for the ""wagon-wheel effect"", so called because in video or motion pictures, spoked wheels on horse-drawn wagons sometimes appear to be turning backwards.\n\nTemporal aliasing is one example of a range of phenomena called aliasing that occur when continuous motion is represented by a series of short or instantaneous samples. It occurs when (a) the view of a moving object is represented by a series of short samples as distinct from a continuous view, and (b) the moving object is in rotational or other cyclic motion at a rate close to the sampling rate.\n\nExplanation\nConsider the stroboscope as used in mechanical analysis. This is a ""strobe light"" that is fired at an adjustable rate. Suppose you are looking at something rotating at 60 revolutions per second: if you view it with a series of short flashes at 60 times per second, each flash illuminates the object at the same position in its rotational cycle, so it appears that the object is stationary. Furthermore, at a frequency of 60 flashes per second, persistence of vision smooths out the sequence of flashes so that the perceived image is continuous.\n\nIf you view the same rotating object at 59 flashes per second, each flash will illuminate it at a slightly different part of its rotational cycle. Fifty-nine flashes will occur before you see the object in the same position again, and you will perceive the series of images as if it is rotating once per second.\n\nThe same effect occurs if you view the object at 61 flashes per second, except that each flash illuminates it a little earlier in its rotational cycle and so, it seems to be rotating backwards.\n\nIn the case of motion pictures, action is captured as a rapid series of still images and the same stroboscopic effect can occur.\n\nWagon-wheel effect\nSee main article: Wagon-wheel effect \nMotion-picture cameras conventionally film at 24 frames per second; however, the wheels of a vehicle are not likely to be turning at 24 revolutions per second, which would be extremely fast. However, suppose each wheel has twelve spokes and rotates at only two revolutions per second. Filmed at 24 frames per second, the spokes in each frame will appear in exactly the same position. Hence, the wheel will be perceived to be stationary. In fact, each photographically captured spoke in any one position will be a different actual spoke in each successive frame, but since the spokes are close to identical in shape and color, no difference will be perceived.\n\nIf the wheel rotates a little more slowly than two revolutions per second, the position of the spokes is seen to fall a little further behind in each successive frame and therefore the wheel will seem to be turning backwards.\n\nDerivation\nThe reason it is called ""aliasing"" is that in electrical engineering, when a continuous signal is replaced by a series of samples — say, a 24.1 Hz signal is sampled 24 times per second — the result seems the same as if a 0.1 Hz signal were sampled 24 times per second, so 0.1 Hz is said to be an ""alias"" of 24.1 Hz.",science_mathematics

"What is limestone?  (m)\n\nLimestone is a sedimentary rock composed largely of the mineral calcite (calcium carbonate: CaCO3). Limestones often contain variable amounts of silica in the form of chert or flint, as well as varying amounts of clay, silt and sand as disseminations, nodules, or layers within the rock. The primary source of the calcite in limestone is most commonly marine organisms. These organisms secrete shells that settle out of the water column and are deposited on ocean floors as pelagic ooze (see lysocline for information on calcite dissolution). Secondary calcite may also be deposited by supersaturated meteoric waters (groundwater that precipitates the material in caves). This produces speleothems such as stalagmites and stalactites. Another form taken by calcite is that of oolites (oolitic limestone) which can be recognised by its granular appearance. Limestone makes up about 10 percent of the total volume of all sedimentary rocks.\n\nPure limestones are white or almost white. Because of impurities, such as clay, sand, organic remains, iron oxide and other materials, many limestones exhibit different colors, especially on weathered surfaces. Limestone may be crystalline, clastic, granular, or massive, depending on the method of formation. Crystals of calcite, quartz, dolomite or barite may line small cavities in the rock. Folk and Dunham classifications are used to describe limestones more precisely.\n\nTravertine is a banded, compact variety of limestone formed along streams, particularly where there are waterfalls and around hot or cold springs. Calcium carbonate is deposited where evaporation of the water leaves a solution that is supersaturated with chemical constituents of calcite. Tufa, a porous or cellular variety of travertine, is found near waterfalls. Coquina is a poorly consolidated limestone composed of pieces of coral or shells.\n\nDuring regional metamorphism limestone recrystallizes into marble.\n\nLimestone is a parent material of Mollisol soil group.",science_mathematics

"Scenario on Chlorine Gas?  Background: Chlorine gas is a pulmonary irritant with intermediate water solubility that causes acute damage in the upper and lower respiratory tract. Chlorine gas was  first used as a chemical weapon at Ypres, France in 1915. Of the 70,552 American soldiers poisoned with various gasses in World War I, 1843 were exposed to chlorine gas.\n    Pathophysiology: Chlorine is a greenish-yellow, noncombustible gas at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. The intermediate water solubility of chlorine accounts for its effect on the upper airway and the lower respiratory tract. Exposure to chlorine gas may be prolonged because its moderate water solubility may not cause upper airway symptoms for several minutes. In addition, the density of the gas is greater than that of air, causing it to remain near ground level and increasing exposure time. The odor threshold for chlorine is approximately 0.3-0.5 parts per million (ppm); however, distinguishing toxic air levels from permissible air levels may be difficult until irritative symptoms are present.\n     Chlorine is moderately soluble in water and reacts in combination to form hypochlorous (HOCl) and hydrochloric (HCl) acids. Elemental chlorine and its derivatives, hydrochloric and hypochlorous acids, may cause biological injury. The chemical reactions of chlorine combining with water and the subsequent derivative reactions with HOCl and HCl are as follows:\n\na1) Cl2 + H2O « HCl (hydrochloric acid) + HOCL (hypochlorous acid) or\n\na2) Cl2 + H2O « 2 HCl + [O-] (nascent oxygen)\n\nb) HOCl « HCl + [O-]\n\n   Mechanism of activity\nThe mechanisms of the above biological activity are poorly understood and the predominant anatomic site of injury may vary, depending on the chemical species produced. Cellular injury is believed to result from the oxidation of functional groups in cell components, from reactions with tissue water to form hypochlorous and hydrochloric acid, and from the generation of free oxygen radicals. Although the idea that chlorine causes direct tissue damage by generating free oxygen radicals was once accepted, this idea is now controversial.\n     Solubility effects\nHydrochloric acid is highly soluble in water. The predominant targets of the acid are the epithelia of the ocular conjunctivae and upper respiratory mucus membranes.\n     Hypochlorous acid is also highly water soluble with an injury pattern similar to hydrochloric acid. Hypochlorous acid may account for the toxicity of elemental chlorine and hydrochloric acid to the human body.\n\n      Early response to chlorine gas\nChlorine gas, when mixed with ammonia, reacts to form chloramine gas. In the presence of water, chloramines decompose to ammonia and hypochlorous acid or hydrochloric acid. The early response to chlorine exposure depends on the (1) concentration of chlorine gas, (2) duration of exposure, (3) water content of the tissues exposed, and (4) individual susceptibility.\n\n      Immediate effects\nThe immediate effects of chlorine gas toxicity include acute inflammation of the conjunctivae, nose, pharynx, larynx, trachea, and bronchi. Irritation of the airway mucosa leads to local edema secondary to active arterial and capillary hyperemia. Plasma exudation results in filling the alveoli with edema fluid, resulting in pulmonary congestion.\n\n     Pathologic findings\nPathologic findings are nonspecific. They include severe pulmonary edema, pneumonia, hyaline membrane formation, multiple pulmonary thromboses, and ulcerative tracheobronchitis.\n\n      The hallmark of pulmonary injury associated with chlorine toxicity is pulmonary edema, manifested as hypoxia. Noncardiogenic pulmonary edema is thought to occur when there is a loss of pulmonary capillary integrity, and subsequent transudation of fluid into the alveolus is present. The onset can occur within minutes or hours, depending upon severity of exposure. Persistent hypoxemia is associated with a higher mortality rate.\n     The eye seldom is",science_mathematics

"Why does Swiss cheese have holes in it?  Swiss cheese holes are caused by gassy bacteria. In order to make cheese, you need the help of bacteria. Starter cultures containing bacteria are added to milk, where they create lactic acid, essential for producing cheese. Various types of bacteria can be used to make cheese, and some cheeses require several different bacteria to give them a particular flavor. \nPropionibacter shermani is one of the three types of bacteria used to make Swiss cheese, and it's responsible for the cheese's distinctive holes. Once P. shermani is added to the cheese mixture and warmed, bubbles of carbon dioxide form. These bubbles become holes in the final product. Cheesemakers can control the size of the holes by changing the acidity, temperature, and curing time of the mixture. Incidentally, those holes are technically called ""eyes,"" and the proper Swiss name for the cheese is Emmentaler.",science_mathematics
"why does most children have a difficultly with the following subjects math and integrated science?  I'm afraid I have to agree with RockyQA, but there is much more to it than that. Most education majors in college are only required to take one or two math and science classes as part of their general education requirements. That hardly qualifies them to teach the subject. I believe that because of this requirement many education majors who are not interested in math and science are more attracted to the major. Finally, since teachers are paid so poorly in this country, the US, people who have math and science skills are much more likely to go into science and engineering professions where their starting pay out of college may be two or three times higher than that for teachers. Is it any wonder there is a problem?\n\nThe other factor that is also to blame is that many parents don't understand math and science either. If kids don't see their parents having an interest in the subject they are much less likely to find it appealing. Then there is the large group of parents who are actively hostile toward science because they believe it conflicts with their religious beliefs. This doesn't help either because the kids often come to school with a closed mind.",science_mathematics
"How long does it take for sandstone to form?  It depends on the type of cement and some other circumstances.\n\nEogenesis (early diagenesis) in sand can create sandstone in as little as a few years, or tens of years in the right environment. Sandstone may be cemented by quartz, calcite, clay minerals, gypsum, anhydrite, iron oxides, and other things. In an evaporitic environment sulphates like gypsum or anhydrite could cement sand into sandstone quite rapidly. Calcite is another cement that could precipitate by rapid evaporation.  One example of an environment where sandstone might form quite rapidly in this manner is an alluvial fan that is close to an evaporitic lake, like in Death Valley. I would suggest that similar environments exist near the Dead Sea.  \n\nHowever, most sandstone is cemented by quartz and clay minerals, and these often take high pressure and temperature to be deposited (diagenesis).  To reach higher pressures it may take many thousands of years, or even millions of years for the unconsolidated sandstone to be buried and eventually cemented. \n\nSource: Notes from Dr. Earl McBride's sedimentology classes.",science_mathematics

"I have an area 8 feet by 8 feet square. To convert to an octagon, what would the length of each side be? I am formulatically challenged. Please explain in simple terms. Thanks. Unfortunately, the people above have misused geometry.\n\nThe way that you'd solve this in a geometry class would involved quite a bit of trigonometry. Here's a way to solve it without using as much. (I worked it out both ways and both methods give the same result. I also checked the result.)\n\nI'm assuming that your octagon is regular.\n\nDraw a regular octagon. Call the length of each side a.\n\nNow use vertical and horizontal lines to draw gridlines on the octogon. This divides the octagon into four triangles, four rectangles, and a square in the middle.\n\nThe square has area a^2..\n\nThe triangles are 45-45-90 triangles having hypotenuse a. This means that both sides are a / square root of 2. This means that each triangle has area:\n\n1/2 * (a / sqr(2)) * (a / sqr(2)) = a^2 / 4.\n\nThe rectangles have one side that is a side of the octagon (a) and one side that is a leg of the triangle (a / sqr(2)).\n\nThis means that the rectangles have area:\n\na * (a / sqr(2)) = a^2 / sqr(2).\n\nThe octagon's area is equal to the sum of the areas of its regions:\n\n4 triangles + 4 rectangles + 1 square\n\n4*(a^2 / 4) + 4*(a^2 / sqr(2)) + a^2 = \n\na^2 + 2sqr(2)*a^2 + a^2 = \n\na^2 (2 + 2sqr(2)) = 64.\n\nSolve for a, and you get approximately 3.6407 feet.\n\nThat is to say, an octagon having a side length of 3.6407 feet has the same area as a square having a side length of 8 feet.\n\nThis seems contradictory until you realize that an regular octagon isn't made up of just squares and triangles.

"what is the principle of welding?  What is welding?\nWelding is joining or fusing of two metals or melting of metals. Two pieces of metals are heated to such a high temperature that their edges become liquid. Then, the two half-liquid state metals are held together so that they join. When they cool down again, the two pieces of metal will be glued to each other so that they cannot be pulled apart\n\nThe principle of welding is quite simple. An electric arc is created between a negative pole, (earthed workpiece) and a positive pole, (welding rod). The amperage of the electric current determines the level of heat and fusion generated. \n\nElectric Arc welding machines come in many sizes, from small luggable units, through to wheelable units and even large fixed machines. \n\nTheir size is determined by the amperage output achieved. Smaller machines are only suitable for welding small sections of metal and rod. \n\nWelding rods are available in different diameter sizes with different flux coatings.",science_mathematics

"Where is the Wall of Space ? Sun is center of this universe, if you draw a line from Sun to Wall the space. How is long? Well, according to most theories, the Universe does not have a 'wall', if by wall you mean boundry.  However, solar systems do have a 'wall'.  This wall is called the heliopause, and marks the boundry where a star's solar winds fade into the interstellar void (the space between the stars).  Any object passing through the heliopause is believed to experience a termination shock.  This is caused by the preasure difference between the solar winds and the void NOT because the object is actually hitting a wall or other physical barrier.  Today, many theories also (as the previous post mentions) suggest that the Universe is both finite yet boundless.  What does this mean?  First, 'finite' means that the Universe is not infinate in size (theoretically we could then assign a number to the its size, much like we assign a number to the size of a piece of land).  However, the Universe has no boundries - it is 'boundless'.  How can something have a finite size and no boundry?  One theory is that the Universe has a shape like a ball.  Imagine you are a tiny person walking on the surface of a basketball.  Assume you can only walk and not fly, jump, etc. No matter how much you walk in any direction, you'll never find an 'edge' (to you, the basketball has no boundry).  However, if you remove the skin from the basketball and lay it flat, it is apparent that the basketball _does_ have a finite (limited) size.  It's hard to imagine it, but picturing the Universe 'flat' and 'wrapped around' itself in a ball (a closed Universe) will allow you to have a Universe without boundries, but with a definate size.  Our minds are not equiped to visualize objects beyond the 3rd dimention (for example, we can't 'see' space-time), so most modling of the Universe makes the most 'sense' when done in calculations.",science_mathematics

"name of the optical effect where a wheel appears to be turning the opposite way?  Temporal aliasing\n\nTemporal aliasing is the term applied to a visual phenomenon also known as the ""stroboscopic effect"". It also accounts for the ""wagon-wheel effect"", so called because in video or motion pictures, spoked wheels on horse-drawn wagons sometimes appear to be turning backwards.\n\nTemporal aliasing is one example of a range of phenomena called aliasing that occur when continuous motion is represented by a series of short or instantaneous samples. It occurs when (a) the view of a moving object is represented by a series of short samples as distinct from a continuous view, and (b) the moving object is in rotational or other cyclic motion at a rate close to the sampling rate.\n\nExplanation\nConsider the stroboscope as used in mechanical analysis. This is a ""strobe light"" that is fired at an adjustable rate. Suppose you are looking at something rotating at 60 revolutions per second: if you view it with a series of short flashes at 60 times per second, each flash illuminates the object at the same position in its rotational cycle, so it appears that the object is stationary. Furthermore, at a frequency of 60 flashes per second, persistence of vision smooths out the sequence of flashes so that the perceived image is continuous.\n\nIf you view the same rotating object at 59 flashes per second, each flash will illuminate it at a slightly different part of its rotational cycle. Fifty-nine flashes will occur before you see the object in the same position again, and you will perceive the series of images as if it is rotating once per second.\n\nThe same effect occurs if you view the object at 61 flashes per second, except that each flash illuminates it a little earlier in its rotational cycle and so, it seems to be rotating backwards.\n\nIn the case of motion pictures, action is captured as a rapid series of still images and the same stroboscopic effect can occur.\n\nWagon-wheel effect\nSee main article: Wagon-wheel effect \nMotion-picture cameras conventionally film at 24 frames per second; however, the wheels of a vehicle are not likely to be turning at 24 revolutions per second, which would be extremely fast. However, suppose each wheel has twelve spokes and rotates at only two revolutions per second. Filmed at 24 frames per second, the spokes in each frame will appear in exactly the same position. Hence, the wheel will be perceived to be stationary. In fact, each photographically captured spoke in any one position will be a different actual spoke in each successive frame, but since the spokes are close to identical in shape and color, no difference will be perceived.\n\nIf the wheel rotates a little more slowly than two revolutions per second, the position of the spokes is seen to fall a little further behind in each successive frame and therefore the wheel will seem to be turning backwards.\n\nDerivation\nThe reason it is called ""aliasing"" is that in electrical engineering, when a continuous signal is replaced by a series of samples — say, a 24.1 Hz signal is sampled 24 times per second — the result seems the same as if a 0.1 Hz signal were sampled 24 times per second, so 0.1 Hz is said to be an ""alias"" of 24.1 Hz.",science_mathematics

In other words, you'd need a telescope 100 times better than the HST and you'd need it to be in space.\n\nAnd just for the hoax lovers ...\n\n1) Twelve 12 American astronauts have walked on the moon.\n\nApollo 11: Neil Armstrong & Buzz Aldrin\nApollo 12: Pete Conrad & Alan Bean\nApollo 13: << failed to land on the moon >>\nApollo 14: Alan Shepard & Edgar (Ed) Mitchell\nApollo 15: David Scott & James Irwin\nApollo 16: John Young & Charles Duke\nApollo 17: Eugene (Gene) Cernan & Harrison Schmidt\n\n\n2) Why haven't we been back?  \n\na) American astronauts visited the moon on six occasions.\n\nb) The ""moon race"" was an extension of the cold war. It was mostly about national prestige. We got there first and achieved our primary objective. There was some good science: surveys, measurements, sample collection. But it was mostly about being there first. Once we achieved our primary objective, there was no political will to go back. There still isn't.  Perhaps, if we discover He3 or something else valuable, there will be.\n\nc) I used to travel to Crested Butte, Colorado every year to ski. Because I don't go anymore, does it mean that I never went?\n\n\n3) What about the Van Allen radiation belts?  Wouldn't it have killed the astronauts?\n\nThe existence of the Van Allen radiation belts postulated in the 1940s by Nicholas Christofilos.  Their existence was confirmed in *1958* by the Explorer I satellite launched by the USA. \n\nThe radiation in the Van Allen radiation belts is not particularly strong.  You would have to hang out there for a week or so in order to get radiation sickness.  And, because the radiation is not particularly strong, a few millimeters of metal is all that is required for protection.  ""An object satellite shielded by 3 mm of aluminum will receive about 2500 rem (25 Sv) per *year*.""\n\n""In practice, Apollo astronauts who travelled to the moon spent very little time in the belts and received a harmless dose. [6]. Nevertheless NASA deliberately timed Apollo launches, and used lunar transfer orbits that only skirted the edge of the belt over the equator to minimise the radiation.""  When the astronauts returned to Earth, their dosimeters showed that they had received about as much radiation as a couple of medical X-rays.\n\n\n4) The U.S. government scammed everyone?  \n\nIn 1972, there was a politically motivated burglary of a hotel room in the Watergate Hotel in Washington, D.C. There were only about six or eight people who knew about it. However, those people, including Richard M. Nixon, the President of the United States, failed to keep that burglary a secret. It exploded into a scandal that drove the President and a number of others from office.\n\nIf six or eight people couldn't keep a hotel room burglary a secret, then how could literally thousands of people could have kept their mouths shut about six faked moon landings? Not just one moon landing, but six of them!\n\n\n5) What about the USSR?  \n\nEven if NASA and other government agencies could have faked the six moon landings well enough to fool the general public, they could NOT have fooled the space agency or military intelligence types in the USSR. The Soviets were just dying to beat us. If the landings were faked, the Soviets would have re-engineered their N-1 booster and landed on the moon just to prove what liars Americans are. Why didn't they? Because the landings were real and the Soviets knew it.\n\n\n6) Why does the flag shake?  Where are the stars?

"What is going to be the next important invention that wiil change life as we now know it? Electricity, anesthesia, internal combustion engines, flight, and computers, to name just a few, are inventions which have altered the course of mankind. What's the next ""big thing"" that is going to profoundly impact our everyday lives? and how so? Manufactured products are made from atoms. The properties of those products depend on how those atoms are arranged. If we rearrange the atoms in coal we can make diamond. If we rearrange the atoms in sand (and add a few other trace elements) we can make computer chips. If we rearrange the atoms in dirt, water and air we can make potatoes. \nTodays manufacturing methods are very crude at the molecular level. Casting, grinding, milling and even lithography move atoms in great thundering statistical herds. It's like trying to make things out of LEGO blocks with boxing gloves on your hands. Yes, you can push the LEGO blocks into great heaps and pile them up, but you can't really snap them together the way you'd like. \nIn the future, nanotechnology will let us take off the boxing gloves. We'll be able to snap together the fundamental building blocks of nature easily, inexpensively and in most of the ways permitted by the laws of physics. This will be essential if we are to continue the revolution in computer hardware beyond about the next decade, and will also let us fabricate an entire new generation of products that are cleaner, stronger, lighter, and more precise. \nIt's worth pointing out that the word ""nanotechnology"" has become very popular and is used to describe many types of research where the characteristic dimensions are less than about 1,000 nanometers. For example, continued improvements in lithography have resulted in line widths that are less than one micron: this work is often called ""nanotechnology."" Sub-micron lithography is clearly very valuable (ask anyone who uses a computer!) but it is equally clear that conventional lithography will not let us build semiconductor devices in which individual dopant atoms are located at specific lattice sites. Many of the exponentially improving trends in computer hardware capability have remained steady for the last 50 years. There is fairly widespread belief that these trends are likely to continue for at least another several years, but then conventional lithography starts to reach its limits. \nThere is also Cold Fusion which holds the promise of easily available low cost energy.  For example buying a car or house which comes with its forever energy.  More can be found at the Cold Fusion Journal http://coldfusion.sys-con.com/",science_mathematics

"How long does it take for an embalmed body to decompose?  Embalming affects the process, slowing it somewhat, but does not forestall it indefinitely. Embalmers typically pay the greatest attention to the parts of the body seen by mourners, such as the face and hands. The chemicals that are used in embalming will repel most insects, and slow the process of bacterial putrefaction (the embalming fluid acts to ""fix"" cellular proteins which means that they cannot act as a nutrient source for bacteria and it also kills the bacteria themselves), but will not preserve a corpse indefinitely. In sufficiently dry environments, an embalmed body may end up mummified and it is not uncommon for bodies in dry vaults to remain preserved to a viewable extent after decades, such as the murdered civil rights activist Medgar Evers. Another case of this would be the body of Lenin, who was kept submerged in a special tank of fluid for decades, almost perfectly preserved[citation needed]. Bodies submerged in peat bogs may become naturally ""embalmed"", arresting decomposition and resulting in a preserved specimen known as a bog body.\n\nThe time for the reduction of an embalmed body to be reduced to a skeleton varies greatly. It is important to note that when a body is decomposed before preparation embalming treatment can still be achieved (the arterial system is slow to decay) although it will not restore a natural appearance without extensive cosmetic and reconstruction work and is largely used to control the foul odours associated with decomposition.",science_mathematics

"Are people made from Stardust?  Absolutely.\n\nIt is now thought (and even more radio telescope survey evidence on this has just come in) that at the very beginning of things (the Big Bang) there was nothing but energy. As the Universe expanded and cooled, elementary particles were formed from that energy, and some time later, things cooled enough for atoms to form and stay together. Since it takes force to push protons together (to form nuclei of the higher atomic number atoms), and the force wasn't available, only hydrogen (and a very small amount of helium and perhaps an even smaller amount of lithium -- the simplest atoms) resulted.\n\nLots of hydrogen, distributed in a sort of clumpy manner, will eventually collapse into stars. Large stars burn through their available fuel relatively quickly, all the while forcing together protons into more complex atoms such as carbon and oxygen and silicon, and so on. When these large stars go nova, they spray a good part of themselves into interstellar space where the material is incorporated into newly forming stars or collected into clouds around them. As those clouds collapse into planets (which must be very common as we have now seen some hundreds of them around stars in the local area in our galaxy (ie, within a few hundred light years)), the non-hydrogen material in them is actually star stuff. Probably not really dust particles in most cases, but...\n\nAnd that's how it was. Fascinating stuff.",science_mathematics

My daughter can tolerate four to five grams of protien per day. This is roughly equivalent to a teaspoon of peanut butter. Many kids can tolerate even less. Pasta and most wheat-based foods must be cautiously monitored due to the high amounts of gluten, which contain protien. The diet is regulated by a special dietary formula drink that 'screens out' phenylalenine, but is fortified with the remaining amino acids. There are phe-free foods which we must purchase, to replace our noodles in her diet. \n\n3) When she was first born, we took her to the only place in the state with extensive knowledge of PKU every month for six months.

"What is the difference between sleet and hail?  Sleet is formed by snow (single ice crystals) being formed in cold clouds and then falling through warmer air so that they begin to partially melt, falling as wet snow - sleet.\n\nHailstones form by water droplets freezing very quickly in a cloud so that they form a small blob or nucleus rather than the larger crystal formed by a slow freezing snow flake crystal. The nucleus continues to fall through the cloud until it meets a strong upcurrent of warmer damper air coming up from the ground.  This blows the ice droplet up into the colder part of the cloud.  the warm air surrounding the nucleus cools and the water in it condenses out and freezes onto the surface of the existing ice droplet making it larger and heavier.  This is cycle isrepeated until the updraught is not strong enough to keep the hailstone airborne and it (and the millions of others with it) drop to the ground.\n\nThe stronger the updraught the larger the final hailstone.\n\nIf you collect some hailstones after they have dropped and use a sharp knife to cleanly cut one in half, you might be able to see the individuals layers of ice within the hailstone through a magnifying glass or microscope.\n\nHailstones can become very very big - have alook at the guiness book of records - but I believe that you Americans hold the record for a hailstone that fell in Kansas, USA, and was measured at 43.18cm (17 in) long - unfortunately no idea of the weight.",science_mathematics

"help me PLZ!? Can some1 explain the chemical principle behind the classification of mixtures & compounds? A mixture is a chemical substance which is a homogeneous or heterogeneous association without chemical bonding of elements and/or compounds in varying proportions and that retain their own individual properties and makeup. Mixtures can usually be separated by mechanical means.\n\nThere are no chemical changes in a mixture, i.e., each substance in a mixture keeps the same chemical properties and makeup as before. Physical properties of mixtures, e.g., the melting point, may considerably differ from those of its components. It usually does not.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\nA chemical compound is a chemical substance formed by chemically combining two or more elements, with a fixed ratio determining the composition. For example, hydrogen oxide (water, H2O) is a compound composed of two hydrogen atoms for every oxygen atom.\n\nA defining characteristic of a compound is that it has a chemical formula. Formulas describe the ratio of atoms in a substance, and the number of atoms in a single molecule of the substance (thus the formula for ethene is C2H4 rather than CH2). The formula does not indicate that a compound is composed of molecules; for example, sodium chloride (table salt, NaCl) is an ionic compound.\n\nCompounds may have a number of possible phases. All compounds can exist as solids. Molecular compounds may also exist as liquids or gases. All compounds will decompose to smaller compounds or individual atoms if heated to a certain temperature (called the decomposition temperature). Every chemical compound that has been described in the literature carries a unique numerical identifier, its CAS number.",science_mathematics

"Can someone explain to me what nonEuclidean geometry is?  Euclidean geometry is the study of geometry as defined by the axioms of Euclid. You can find those axioms here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_Geometry .\nIt was noted by Klein that Euclidean geometry was actually just the study of one particular group of symmetries. His Erlangen program of 1872 revolutionized geometry by encouraging the stuidy of non-Euclidean geometries by simply studying the geometries produced by any arbitrary group.\nGauss and Riemann realized that while Euclidean geometry did not deal with a fundamental unit of length, the study of geometry on curved surfaces did introduce fundamental units of length (this was later applied in general relativity). The geometry on these surfaces, such as the sphere where parallel lines can meet at either 2 points or none, definitely did not satisfy Euclid's axioms, so they were also non-Euclidean. The Riemann sphere's relation to the complex plane made this geometry very useful. The projective plane is a non-Euclidean geometry that has found many applications as well. \nBasically, non-Euclidean geometry pops up whenever a surface (or an arbitrary smooth manifold) has non-zero Gaussian curvature. Things can get pretty wild in more than 2 dimensions.

We humans tend to alter our surroundings to more fit us.\nAnother reason is physical barrier (and then go back to number one), so two populations evolve differently...due to their different surroundings.

"what is the scattering of alpha partical? I'm talking about ratherford pattern Rutherford's Discovery of Alpha Scattering\nI. The French Start First\n\nIn 1900, the Curies and Becquerel were studying radioactivity (Rutherford was in Canada, having just recently moved to McGill University in Montreal. He will return to England, but not for several years.) and they had occasion to determine if the alpha rays traveled in a straight line. Becquerel carried out the work.\n\nHe took some polonium (discovered by Pierre and Marie Curie) and made it into a straight line source, not the usual pencil of rays. He then used this long, narrow beam of alpha rays to make a photograph of a wire. He found that the shadows had sharp edges, even when the alpha rays had gone through a thin film of aluminum.\n\nMarie Curie gave the interpretation of the experiment. She said that this showed that the alpha particles were not scattered, that is, able to be bent from their path. Alpha rays traveled in nice, straight lines ALL THE TIME.\n\nThey were wrong.\n\nWe jump to 1903 and Rutherford announces he has succeeded in bending alpha particles with a magnetic (and an electrical) field. Becquerel, using his different techniques, checks and confirms Rutherford's results.\n\nWhat Becquerel does is aim his radioactive source (radium, now as well as polonium) at a narrow slit with a photographic plate on the other side. Of course, with no magnetic field, he gets a nice, crisp image of the narrow slit, directly in line with the radium source.\n\nWhen he turned on the magnetic field, he got Rutherford's result, that is, the alpha particles bent in the magnetic field.\n\nPart b of the figure shows the offset of the image on the photographic plate. It is not lined up directly with the open slit, labeled Y.\n\nBecquerel also reversed the magentic field's direction during the exposure and got a double image.\n\nThe images were exactly the same distance from the center and the edges of the traces ALWAYS were sharp and crisp.\n\nUp to this point, there was zero evidence of alpha particle scattering.\n\nII. Now, the evidence starts to accumulate\n\nThe work described above was all done in the early part of 1903 and it was in June of 1903 that Becquerel made the first observation that led to alpha particle scattering.\n\nHe noticed, right at the end of his experiments, that the images from the doubled set (when he reversed the magnetic field during the experiment) moved closer together as he moved the photographic plate away from the slit (that is, increased the length b in the diagram above).\n\nIt seemed that the radius of curvature of the alpha particles path through the slit Y increased as b increased, thereby moving the two images closer together.\n\nNow, Becquerel knew this equation:\n\nRH = v (M/E)\n\nR = the radius of curvature, H = the magnetic field strength, v is the velocity, and E/M is the charge-to-mass ratio of the alpha particle. (I know, I know, this equation just came out of nowhere. You'll have to trust me on this one, since I don't know how to derive the equation either.)\n\nWhat Becquerel did is assume E is constant, so this left him with the unpleasant thought that either v or M had to increase. Since it is very had to visualize the alpha particle SPEEDING UP as it traveled from its source, Bequerel decided that M must increase, that the alpha particle picked up stray matter as it traveled along.\n\nHe could not have liked it, but there wasn't anything else he could think of. Since Rutherford was busy with other work, he did not take up any checking on Becquerel's results. However, one Rutherford result will have bearing on scattering. Rutherford found (in July 1905) that the alpha particle decreased in velocity, until at about 6,000 miles per second, it would not make its presence known by ionizing gases or darkening a photographic plate.\n\nIII. We're getting there\n\nThe importance of the slowing down of the alpha particle meant that R (the radius of the curvature in a magnetic field) ",science_mathematics

"what will happen if we drink highly pure water?  As long as you eat and drink normally, nothing should happen. If you drank deionized water without consuming anything else for a very extended period of time... significant amounts of your cells would probably rupture. Your body maintains an ionic strength equilibrium, that is maintained through the process of osmosis. If the environment outside your cells becomes decreased in ions, water will flow into the cell across your cell membrane to maintain the ionic balance. If too much water is taken up into the cells, they explode. However, it would take quite a while to deplete your ionic store so low to cause this to happen on a large scale. If deionized water were introduced directly into your, say, bloodsteam... then the local environment around your blood cells would be so low in ions as to cause your blood cells to rupture... This is why you will see saline solutions, not water, pumped into people in the hospital to keep them hydrated. \n\nConversely, if you drink sea water, you rapidly overload your extracellular fluids with salts, increasing the ionic strenth outside your cells. Water flows out of your cells to balance the ions, and your cells literally dry up. Since your body used water to flush excess ions from your system to avoid a build-up, when your only way to replace that water is to add huge amounts of ions, that requires more water to flush out than you are  taking in... well... you ""dry up"" and die. That is why you should NEVER drink sea water.\n\n:-)",science_mathematics
"How come soap even though it is made with oil removes oil from our skin? How does that work? Some soap is made from olive oil yet removes oil.\n\nThanks. Hi there,\n\nSoap is able to remove oil from our skin because while you've rightly pointed out soap is made from oil, its chemical and molecular structure consists of 2 main parts that are attracted to oily substances (known as the hydrophobic part) and a part that is attracted to water-based or aqueous substances (known as the hydrophilic part). Because of this property, soap can break up the oil on our skin and bind it to the water- Allowing us to remove the oil from our skin.  As an aside, you should know that normally Water and Oil dont mix at all- If you add some some liquid soap to a mixture of water and oil you will notice that the oil and water will mix togther!!

"why does aluminum not rust?  Aluminum DOES rust; it just isn't like iron rust. Aluminum oxide (chemical formula Al2O3) forms a thin film on the outside of the aluminum. \n\nSome people say, figuratively, that we have never really seen aluminum, because the oxide coating forms so quickly; (I have to disagree with what someone else wrote above) you can't scratch aluminum and then see the true color before the oxide covers it.\n\nAl2O3 is chemically the same as sapphire, it is very hard and strong. Once the coating has formed on the surface, it protects the rest of the aluminum in the bulk of the piece, so it doesnt corrode away. The coating is very thin, though-- only one molecule thick-- so we don't notice it and it doesn't really add any structural strength to the aluminum. \n\nBy contrast, iron rust is very weak. It crumbles and falls apart very easily; it can't even support its own weight. So it breaks off the surface of the iron and leaves fresh iron exposed to rust.

Black rats tend to spend more time  climbing than brown rats.  They were once a comparable problem  aboard ships as they were very happy in the riggings of wooden sailing vessels.  Now they are much less common in the metal/concrete hulls of modern ships.\n\nIf you define rat to more broadly mean largeish murines, then there are many arboreal varieties.  The Philippines have a radaition of almost squirrel-like rats that include the cloudrunners (Crateromys).  Dephomys, Grammomys, Hylomyscus, Lenothrix, Mallomys, Mesembriomys, Phloeomys, Pogonomys, and Vandeleuria are all genera of Old World rats (some border on being ""mice"") that spend much of their time in trees.",science_mathematics
"On what basis are maps drawn?Are the borders given in maps absolutely perfect? I want to know which people draw maps and how do they do the same.... In past times, drawing maps was an extremely difficult task: without airplanes, maps were built together by joining many heterogeneous measurements and observations from different explorers, on earth and oceans all around the world. Every map was somehow unique and contained big flaws. If you look at the maps of South America from the years 1500-1600, you will see that there is no west border of Peru, because the Pacific Ocean was still unknown, and other big lands as Australia and Antarctica were absent...!\nAs the explorations increased, the maps improved, but the process was slow.\n\nA quality leap took place with the introduction of aerial photographs. Putting together photographs with a little bit of geometry, you can easily derive precise maps. Still, it requires a lot of work.\n\nNowadays, the entire Earth surface is monitored real-time by orbiting satellites, with an accuracy of a few meters. Starting from these data, image-processing computers can automatically draw maps in 2D or 3D as part of an almost fully automated process. No differences can be found between today's maps, because they rely on the same measurements and there is very little margin to any improvement. So, we can say that today, the Earth mapping and the matching between different maps is a completely solved problem.",science_mathematics
"Question about Life in the Universe? According to NASA, and other scientists that peer into the depths of our Universe. We have not been able to idenfify even the smallest form of life! We have been searching for years but have failed. I have no religious affiliation with anything, but I believe that if we find life on another planet(particularly intelligent life), we will be eliminating organized religion. Can someone give some insight as to life in the universe, whether small or intelligent... It's hardly surprising that we can see no sign of life out there.  Views of Earth taken from unmanned explorer craft like Voyager taken from within our own solar system show no signs of life either. If you can't see elephants, whales or even forests from only a few million miles away then looking at hazy dots that are planets thousands of light years away expecting to see obvious signs of life is a bit optimistic.\n\nIn addition, given the size of the Universe we can hardly claim to have looked everywhere whilst at the same time it seems inconceivable that some form of life has not evolved somewhere else.\n\nSpectroscopic analysis of stellar nebulae and other ""gas clouds"" in deep space has revealed the existence of basic organic compounds such as amino acids which are regarded as fundamental building blocks of all living things here on Earth. So if life itself hasn't been located elsewhere, some of the prerequisite precursors certainly have.\n\nThere are also several ""fossils"" found on meteorites believed to have come from Mars which may or may not prove to be the remains of living things which originated on Mars.",science_mathematics

"why do magnets attract metal?  I've already answered this question and you might want to refer to that for more details. But here goes. \n\nA magnet is made of ferromagnetic materials, and will only attract ferromagnetic materials. These are iron, nickel and cobalt. Any alloy that contains one or more of those is ferromagnetic.\n\nThe metal forms tiny grains as it cools from a liquid to a solid, and within these tiny grains are even smaller regions called magnetic domains. Think of groups of atoms packed together. Unless a material is abolutely pure, there will be odd atoms of other elements and when the metal cools, they do not stack together absolutely correctly. If it is only a tiny amount of impurities, we do not notice the difference in terms of size, shape or weight.\n\nBut the domains are not lined up the same. Think of a bunch of guys just starting basic training. They are all milling around on the parade ground. But let's say that we heat the bar of metal until it is almost ready to melt and then subect it to a strong magnetic field (stick it inside the coil of a strong electromagnet, and let it cool that way.)\n\nNow they are all lined up the same way (just the way a bunch of paper clips will al line up when you pick them up with a magnet.) And when the metal cools and become solid once more, now they stay in that position. It is like a drill sergeant coming and yelling at the new recruits until they line up in formation. Now they are ready to take orders and get some useful work done.\n\nWhen the troops all line up and march the same way, you can see the result. They are more orderly, when they march along their feet all hit the ground at once, and they look unstoppable! \n\nIt is the same way with the magentic material. Each one of the individual atoms has its own magnetic field, but when they are all pointing in random directions, nothing useful can be done. Some are pointing one way, some the opposite way. They act against each other and their corporate effect cannot be felt.\n\nSo, now that the atoms within the domains are lined up together, and the metal has cooled and solidified into a solid bar again, the domains are lined up in formation. Now, they are all pointing in the same direction and we can feel the effects of the magnetic field even outside the magnet itself. The magnetic field reaches beyond the magnet and loops around in space until it reaches the other pole, forming a sort of circuit.\n\nOkay, now we have a magnet and we can understand why it attracts another magnet, because opposite poles attract. north attracts south and south attracts north. (No such thing as gay magnets! it's a law of nature!). \n\nBut why does it attract ordinary non-magnetized iron or steel?\n\nThat has to do with the fact that even though the metal is solid, and the atoms cannot flow away as in a liquid, the atoms are still free to rotate in place without moving from where they are.\n\nThink of the group of raw recruits before they go through their basic training. They are standing around. All of a sudden, they hear a loud noice. It is the drill sergeant yelling at them. All their heads turn in his direction! He has their attention. It is the same way with a magnet.\n\nWhen the magnetic field of a magnet acts on the atoms (iron, nickel or cobalt) of a piece of ferromagnetic alloy that has not yet been magentized, even though the atoms can't move from their spots, they rotate to face in the direction of the magnetic field. They temporarily act together, just as the domains inside the permanent magnet do. The fancy scientific name for this is 'magnetic induction'.\n\nNow, the temporary (induced) pole in the piece of metal is attracted to the permanent pole of the permanent magnet. They move together, because the tendency is for the magnetic field to travel as short a distance as possible, and a pole alwasy induces the opposite pole. The two together, so the magnetic field can travel across the shortest possible distance.\n\nWhen the",science_mathematics
"Do animals have blood groups/types like humans?  In man blood group is applied to single factor. This factor is agglutinogen and is also called antigen. It is found on the surface of red blood corpuscles. \n\nAccordingly a person with `A' antigen is designated as a person with A-group, with `B' antigen as B-group, with both A and B antigens as AB-blood group and a person without any antigens is designated as O-blood group. \n\nIn the case of animals blood group is applied to combinations of blood factors. So it is preferable to call it as blood group systems rather then blood groups. Each system has many factors, which are together called blood group factors. \n\nDr. J. Moustgaard, of the Royal Veterinary & Agricultural College, Copenhagen has identified in cattle ten group systems namely A,B,C,FV,J,L,M,SU, Z and R'S'. Except J and L, all the other group systems have more than one group factor. For example the group factors of the group system A are designated as A{-1}, A{-2}, D, H, Z'. \n\nThe grouping factors are particular serum proteins. Acquiring of each protein is an inherited character. So examination of blood sample from within a breed might eventually prove a very useful means of selection. It might also indicate what mating could be expected to result in infertility. \n\nThe B-group system only has greater number of grouping factors. It has nearly 27 group factors, which are called phenogroups. Some of these are unique to particular breeds. \n\nThey are particularly valuable in determining incorrectly stated parentage. In dogs serum major groups have been recognised in the USA and they are referred to as A to G. \n\nIn veterinary practice blood transfusion is used in cases of haemorrhage and shock and to a lesser extent as part of the treatment of certain infectious diseases. \n\nIn cattle the donor and recipient are usually in the same herd. This fact lessens the risk of introducing infection and incompatibility does not arise. \n\nBut normal antibodies against the blood group factor-J are sometimes found in cattle. Thus if the donor's blood is J-positive and the recipient's blood contains normal antibody called anti-J the so-called transfusion reaction might be expected immediately following blood transfusion. These reactions are dyspnoea, muscular twisting, increased salivation and circulatory disturbances. \n\nHowever, if an animal has been exposed to repeated blood transfusions, a different situation will arise. The animal will now have formed antibodies against the blood group antigens it does not have itself. It is therefore by no means unlikely that the blood of donor and the recipient are incompatible. \n\nIf this is so, transfusion will set off strong transfusion reactions. Such reaction can occur on the second or on subsequent blood transfusion\n\nI hope this helps!",science_mathematics

Well I would use examples and predictions. \n\nFirst I would say, there are TWO theories of relativity: the special theory, and the general theory. \n\nSpecial Theory\n--------------\n\nRather than go into an explanation of the why the speed of light is constant in all inertial frames, I would mention the predictions of the special theory. \n\n1. Nothing can go faster than the speed of light, which is like a speed limit for the universe. I think most children have seen speed limits, so this might seem familiar to them.  \n\n2. If you are in a space ship going very fast, close to the speed of light, time will slow down and you will age more slowly.\n\n3. If you are in a space ship going very fast, close to the speed of light, you will get shorter from front to back. You will become flattened like a pancake.\n\n4. If you are in a space ship going very fast, close to the speed of light, your mass will increase, so that if you were weighed you would be heavier. \n\nGeneral Theory\n---------------\n\nRather than talking about the curvature of space-time, I would again use the predictions of the general theory. \n\n1. When something is very heavy, it has a lot of gravity, and it can even pull on light. In this way, light can be bent. \n\n2. If the object is very heavy, the light is unable to get away at all, so we call the object a black hole. \n\nThis is good enough to start and whet their appetites.

"communication?  Communication\nI  INTRODUCTION \n\nCommunication, the process of transmitting and receiving ideas, information, and messages. The rapid transmission of information over long distances and ready access to information have become conspicuous and important features of human society, especially in the past 150 years, and in the past two decades, increasingly so.\n\nII  ORIGINS \n\nCommunication between two people is an outgrowth of methods developed over centuries of expression. Gestures, the development of language, and the necessity to engage in joint action all played a part.\n\nA  Communication Among Animals \n\nCharles Darwin pointed up the importance of communication and expressiveness in biological survival. Recent studies have dealt with the range of animal communication. For example, when bees discover a source of nectar, they reveal its location to the other bees on returning to the hive. They communicate the distance to the source by means of a dance; the direction is indicated by the angle of the axis of the dance, and the amount of nectar by the vigorousness of the dance. Scientists have recorded and identified birdcalls for courting, mating, hunger, food bearing, territoriality, warning, and distress. Research into the behaviour of whales and dolphins has revealed that they have relatively elaborate vocal signals and that they communicate over long distances underwater. See Animal Behaviour.\n\nB  Language \n\nThe origin of language is subject to considerable speculation. Some words may be imitative of natural sounds. Others may have come from expressions of emotion, such as laughter or crying. Language, some theorists believe, is an outgrowth of group activities, such as working together or dancing. Another theory holds that language developed from basic sounds that accompanied gestures.\n\nSome 3,000 languages and major dialects are spoken in the world today, most of them grouped in families. As some languages grow, others decline and disappear. The changes in language reflect class, gender, profession, age group, and other social forces, such as the effects of technology on everyday life.\n\nC  Symbols and Alphabets \n\nEarly peoples sought the means by which to record language. They drew and painted on cave walls to convey messages and they used signs and symbols to designate tribe or ownership. As human knowledge expanded, writing became necessary in order to transmit information. The earliest writing was pictographic, with symbols representing objects. The first pictographic writing was cuneiform, by which wedge-shaped characters were inscribed with a stylus on a clay tablet. Cuneiform later developed ideographic elements; the symbol came to represent not only the object but also ideas and qualities associated with it.\n\nWriting, however, continued to convey only the meaning, not the sound, of words. Eventually, cuneiform incorporated phonetic elements, that is, signs that represented certain sounds. Egyptian hieroglyphs underwent a similar development. This system progressed from pictograms to ideograms; it incorporated signs for consonants, but it never developed into an alphabet. The alphabet, invented in the Middle East, was carried by the Phoenicians to Greece, where vowel sounds were added to it. The Cyrillic alphabet was adapted from the Greek; the Latin alphabet developed in countries farther to the west where the Roman culture was dominant.\n\nIII  COMMUNICATING AT A DISTANCE \n\nWith the growth of civilization and the development of written languages came the need to communicate regularly at longer distances as well, so as to conduct the trade and other affairs of nations and empires.\n\nA  Paper and Printing \n\nThe Egyptians discovered that a kind of writing material could be made from strips of the stem of the papyrus plant. A later discovery was parchment, which was made by preparing both sides of a sheet of animal tissue for writing uses. Meanwhile in China, about 105 ad, the method of papermaki",science_mathematics

"What kinds of superconductors are there? On the news about a decade ago they were talking a lot about high temperature superconductors.  They were talking about superconductors of electricity.  Are there other types of superconductors, like maybe a superconductor of heat, or a superconductor of sound, or a superconductor of light? Superconductors conduct electricity with little or no resistance. Organic superconductors contain carbon and are less dense than their ceramic or metallic counterparts; they also offer unusual potential for fine-tuning of electrical properties. Argonne National Laboratory long has carried out the major U.S. effort to synthesize and identify organic superconductors. Nearly 100 new superconductors of this type have been produced, with critical temperatures (at which a superconductor loses all electrical resistance) as high as -260 degrees C, or -434 degrees F. Recently, the first superconductor composed entirely of organic components (with no metal atoms) was synthesized, with a transition temperature in this range. Although this remains far lower than the highest known transition temperature for ceramics, scientists still expect that a high-temperature organic superconductor may be possible, such that liquid nitrogen (at -196 degrees C, or -321 degrees F) could be used as the coolant instead of the more costly liquid helium, thus making practical applications more feasible. The new compound has a two-dimensional, layered structure, which may provide significant insight into the nature of superconductivity.",science_mathematics

It's very sloppy of us since no classification systems actually uses it.\n\nWhen we speak of cryptogams we are really referring to anything that photosynthesises that doesn't produce seeds. So the term tends to encompass lichens and algae as well bryophytes and pteridophytes.\n\nSorry I can't be any clearer on this point but really they shouldn't be teaching this term to HS students. It is taxonomically even more obsolete than ""thallophyte"" and will probably only confuse you.\n\nThe only simple answer is that ""cryptogam"" is an informal term that means whatever the user intends it to mean and can include ferns, mosses lichens alage and occasionally even fungi.",science_mathematics

"What is exactly mean 4D? i heard that there is 11D how can that be possible? please do tell me about dimensional theory and who proposed it. This is a very difficult concept and you probably won't get a great answer for it.  First off, this is only speculation - there is not a shred of evidence that there are 11 physical dimensions.  We can only claim 3 (time is considered the 4th dimension, because you need all 4 to describe to fully describe an event - for example, if you throw a rock in the air, if you want to know everything about where it lands you have to know the longitude, latitude, altitude and time with regards to a reference point).\n\n11 physical dimensions spring from string theory, which postulates that everything including time and space and matter and force are made up of vibrating ""strings"", either open ended or looped like rubber bands.  These strings are inconceivably tiny - if an electron were the size of the solar system out to Jupiter's orbit, filling in the volume, the string would be about the size of a granny apple.  It's thought that physical dimension 4-11 curled in on themselves at the Big Bang, and are only relevant on the same scales as the strings themselves - the other 3 expanded to fill the universe that we know today.\n\nOne way to image it is to imagine the Earth as a perfect sphere, without mountains or valleys, no hills, no riverbanks, no sidewalks, just a perfect, absolutely perfect sphere.  Now imagine an ant walking on the sphere.  The Earth is so fricken huge compared to the ant that the ant will only think there are two dimensions, x and y (assume that the ant has no self-awareness, and didn't realize he himself is above the x-y plane).  In reality, the Earth is a sphere, with a z component, but the ant will never know that.  The same, in reverse, could be true for the other 7 dimensions - they are so small we can never comprehend them.\n\nUnfortunately, with today's physics, that also means we can never confirm or deny their existence.  Without empirical proof, string theory is just beautiful mathematics, without a shred of proof.",science_mathematics

"Do the people who are blind from birth have dreams when they sleep?. How can they visualise things that they h How can they visualise things that they have not seen?\n\nThanks\nAnand While there may be exceptions, in general the dreams of the congenitally blind contain no visual elements and consist predominantly of sound plus smell, touch and the sense of movement.\n\nPlotwise they tend to to be reality-based--e.g., a reprise of the events of the day--with less of the fantasy you find in the dreams of sighted people. There's also more conversation.\n\nPersons who become blind after birth often see in their dreams, although it depends on (a) how old they were when they became blind and (b) how long it's been since. If you're blinded before the age of six or seven you generally see little or nothing in your dreams.\n\nDreams of people who become blind when older are often indistinguishable from those of the sighted, but as time goes on many ""see"" less and less.\n\nTo some extent, I gather, the lack of visual elements in the dreams of the blind can be counteracted by force of imagination. Helen Keller, who became blind at the age of 19 months, claimed to have ""visions of ineffable beauty."" These ran to things like pearls.\n\nTo my mind this betrays a certain want of ambition.

You've already got the answer: the margin of error is 4%, at the 95% confidence level. That means that, whatever the results of the poll shows, we can be 95% confident that the poll result will be within 4% of the population mean -- regardless of what the population mean happens to be.\n\nIn other words, suppose we were to sample the same population 100 times with 100 different polls, each of which sampled 500 people. And then suppose we had an actual vote, where we canvassed every single person in the population and recorded the results, and determined the true population mean.

"When pencil was invented?  The ""lead"" pencil (which contains no lead) was invented in 1564 when a huge graphite (black carbon) mine was discovered in Borrowdale, Cumbria, England. The pure graphite was sawn into sheets and then cut into square rods. The graphite rods were inserted into hand-carved wooden holders, forming pencils. They were called lead pencils by mistake - at the time, the newly-discovered graphite was called black lead or ""plumbago,"" from the Latin word for lead ore - it looked and acted like lead, and it was not known at the time that graphite consisted of carbon and not lead. The English had a monopoly on the production of pencils since no other pure graphite mines were known and no one had yet found a way to make graphite sticks. \nThe Germans manufactured graphite sticks (made from powdered graphite), but they were impractical. In 1795, the Nicholas Jacques Conte (a French officer in Napoleon's army) patented the modern method of kiln-firing powdered graphite with clay to make graphite rods fro pencils. By varying the ratio of graphite to clay, the hardness of the graphite can also vary. \n\nBefore themid-1500s, ""pencils"" consisted of a thin rod composed of soft lead, and were used mostly by artists. The word pencil comes from the Latin word ""penicillus,"" which means ""little tail"" - the name of the tiny brush that ancient Romans used as a writing instrument. Graphite (named for the Greek word meaning ""to write"") was chemically analyzed in 1779 (by K.W. Scheele) and named in 1789 (by A.G. Werner).",science_mathematics

"What is a flood? Where is a flood? When does a flood occur? Who does a flood effect? Why does a flood occur?  flood (in Old English flod, a word common to Teutonic languages; compare German Flut, Dutch vloed from the same root as is seen in flow, float) is an overflow of water, an expanse of water submerging land, a deluge. In the sense of ""flowing water"", the word is applied to the inflow of the tide, as opposed to the outflow or ""ebb"". The Flood, the great Universal Deluge of myth and perhaps of history is treated at Deluge in mythology.\n\n \nFlooding in Asheville, North Carolina in July 1916In many arid regions of the world, the soil has very poor water retention characteristics, or the amount of rainfall exceeds the ground's ability to absorb water. When a rainfall does occur, it can sometimes result in a sudden flood of water filling dry streambeds known as a ""flash flood"".\n\nFlood from sea can cause overflow or overtopping of flood-defences like dikes as well as flattening of dunes or buffs. Land behind the coastal defence may be inundated or experience damage. Floods from sea may be caused by heavy storm (storm surge), high tide, a tsunami or a combination thereoff. As most urban communities are located near the coast, this is a major threat around the world.\n\nMany rivers that flow over relatively flat land border on broad flood plains. When heavy rainfall or melting snow causes the river's depth to increase and the river to overflow its banks, a vast expanse of shallow water can rapidly cover the adjacent flood plain. Flooding deposits silt on the flood plain, improving its fertility. Throughout history, this has attracted agriculture and other human development. In order to preserve these farms and cities, some rivers prone to flooding have had extensive and elaborate systems of dikes constructed along their shores and surrounding nearby cities. Unfortunately, by restraining flood waters, these dikes can result in much greater flooding downstream and in locations where they break. Because off the dikes the difference between water-level during flood and the surface of the inland increases and the potential devastation of the flood increases. The control of annual flooding, by dikes and by dams, also prevents the deposition of silt on the rich farmlands and can result in their eventual depletion. The annual cycle of flood and farming was of great significance to many early farming cultures, most famously to the ancient Egyptians of the Nile river and to the Mesopotamians of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers.\n\nA flood occurs when an area of land, usually low-lying, is covered with water. The worst floods usually occur when a river overflows its banks. An example of this is the January 1999 Queensland floods, which swamped south-eastern Queensland. Floods happen when soil and vegetation cannot absorb all the water ; water then runs off the land in quantities that cannot be carried in stream channels or kept in natural ponds or man-made reservoirs.\n\nPeriodic floods occur naturally on many rivers, forming an area known as the flood plain. These river floods usually result from heavy rain, sometimes combined with melting snow, which causes the rivers to overflow their banks. A flood that rises and falls rapidly with little or no advance warning is called a flash flood. Flash floods usually result from intense rainfall over a relatively small area. Coastal areas are occasionally flooded by high tides caused by severe winds on ocean surfaces, or by tidal waves caused by undersea earthquakes. There are often many causes for a flood.\n\nMonsoon rainfalls can cause disastrous flooding in some equatorial countries, such as Bangladesh, due to their extended periods of rainfall. Heavy rain caused substantial damage across eastern Europe in the summers of 2003 and 2005. Normally riverine floods occur only in winter as a result of heavy rain in combination with melting of snow and glaciers in spring.\n\nA flood can also occur when a volcanic eruption melts a large amount of ice and snow quickly.

We have the torque as .85 newton*meters. We can get the answer by a simple dimensional analysis. A newton is actually a kilogram*meter / second^2. We have the length and the mass.

"WIMPs or MACHOs, which impacts Omega more?  Well, people have been spotting and reporting MACHOs for a long time, simply by how they affect light that passes through them.\n\nI believe that WIMPs, if they exist, would be the source for more of the energy density requirements to keep omega at ~1. MACHOs only exist within galactic halos, and are aggregated. WIMPs, on the other hand, are likely to be evenly distriubuted within and between galaxies, acounting for their rotation and their movements relative to one another. I think the lack of information about WIMPs is simply due to the limits of our technology in being able to detect particles that only respond to gravitational fields and require a lot of energy to make because they are heavy. If a particle does not interact with any force at all except gravity, it is likely to be a long time before we ever prove that it exists.\n\nI also think that the fermionic superpartner to the Higgs boson is a good candidate for the WIMP, and it is likely that the debate on the existence of supersymmetric particles will be put to rest as soon as those giant particle accelerators are built in Europe.

PV/T = 30/273.\n\nFinally V = 20, T = 303.\nTherefore PV/T = 20P/ 303\n\nSo 20P/303 = 30/273\n\nSo P = (303*30)/(20*273)\n= 1.66 atmospheres.\n\nFor 56) The volume the gas occupies is proportional to the no. of moles of the gas.\n\nSince the no. of moles of O2 in SO2 is the same, it will be the same == 3.5 liters\n\nFor 72) STP = standard temperature and pressure = 0 Celsius and 1 atmospheric pressure.",science_mathematics

"I'm a teacher (but not in math). Is there any easy way of figuring out a grading curve? I have several hundred students and have 10 quizzes and a final to figure out.  I'm wondering if there is any (reasonably intuitive) formula I could use to get a grading curve. There are lots of ways to do this. Most of them assume a distribution to the data, that is, sort of a histogram of the scores. So for example, a bell curve (also called a normal distribution or a Gaussian distribution) is a very common curve to grade on. It is not that fair in some ways, because it is symmetric, and students on the bottom of the curve might feel short changed. If you have a group of very good students, or a group of very bad students, things can be a bit distorted.  \n\n\nSome of the methods are pretty technical. But there might be some easy ways to do this. \n\nThe first method sort of automates the procedure described by the previous answers. It has the advantage that if anyone asks, you can tell them you really DID use a normal distribution curve and here are the parameters involved etc. I do not know if this is an important consideration in this situation for you, however, or not. \n \nIn comment 2., a number of other methods are mentioned, particularly in the references, but I suspect these might be too technical for your needs. \n\n1. Try just sorting the students into groups and then assigning grades to each group. Sort the student's grades, smallest to largest. Then suppose you want to give out grades A, B, C, D, and F. This method depends on knowing where the middle is, and what standard deviation is. \n\nFor the middle: try taking an arithmetic average. Just add up all the scores Xj, and divide by the number of students N. Something like : \n\nM=Sum Xj/N\n\nFor the standard deviation: This is a bit trickier, but not too bad with a computer or calculator. Take each score, subtract off the arithmetic average from the score, square the resulting number and add all these numbers, dividing by N-1. Something like:\n\nSD=Sum [(Xj-M)^2]/(N-1)\n\n\nIf you can't do this yourself easily, there are calculators to do this on the internet. For example, look at web sites in references 1 and 2.\n\nThen go to the third web site in the references (ref 3) and type in your values for mean and SD. \n\n\nSuppose that you find mean =60 and SD=10. Then type it in the spaces in the web calculator. \n\nEntering different values in the calculator will tell you what proportion of students are in a category. So suppose you decide that all students with grades less than 40 will get an F. Type in 40 on the calculator, and then you find that this corresponds to a shaded area on the curve of 0.022750. This means that 2.275% of the students will be assigned an F. \n\nTake the bottom 2.3% of the students and give them an F.\n\nThen suppose you decide that scores from 40 to 50 should get a D. Type in the spaces in the calculator, that you want the area between 40 and 50. The calculator tells you that this area is 0.135905. \n\nTake the next 13.6 % and give them a D. \n\nSuppose you decide that the scores between 50 and 60 will get a C. Type into the website calculator, you want the area between 50 and 60. The calculator tells you the area is 0.341345. \n\nTake the next 34% and give them a C. \n\nSuppose you decide that the students with scores between 60 (the average remember) and say 70 should get a B. Into the web calculator, look for the area beween 60 and 70. The calculator tells you the area is .341345 again. \n\nSo take the next 34% and give them a B. \n\nSuppose you decide that all students with a score above 70 should get an A. In the web calculator, look for the area above 70 and you find that the area is 0.158655. \n\n\nThe top 16% get an A. \n\nNotice this is still sort of arbitrary, since you are deciding what is an F, a D, a C, a B and an A. But you are using the normal distribution to help you a bit. \n\nYou can play around with this quite a bit. You can make it so the same number of students who get an F get an A, and same number who get a D get a B. However, even though it is done on a ""curve"", it is all still quite arbitrary. You really do not need the web calculator except to help you get a feel for ",science_mathematics

Can somebody give a step by step guide on solving quadratics and completing the square? Thanks Let's start with an equation of the form: x^2 + bx + c = 0.\nThis means that x^2 + bx = -c.\n\nConsider the formula ( x + k )^2 = x^2 + 2k x + k^2.  Every perfect square is in this form.\nWe want to change x^2 + bx into a perfect square.  That means we need to determine what to add to put x^2 + bx into this form.\n\nBy equating coefficients:  bx = 2k x.  That means k = (b/2)\nThus k^2 = (b/2)^2.\n\nAdding (b/2)^2 to both sides of our earlier equation we arrive at:\n\nx^2 + b x + (b/2)^2 = -c + (b/2)^2\n\nWe added this to convert the left hand side into the form of a perfect square.  Thus we can factor it as a square.\n\n(x + b/2)^2 = -c + (b/2)^2\n\nTake the square root of both sides ( for now just assume that the right hand side is positive ).\n\n( x + b/2 ) = +/- sqrt( -c + (b/2)^2 )\n\nnow solve for x:\n\nx = -b/2 +/- sqrt( -c + (b/2)^2 )\n\nExample:\n\nSolve x^2 - 6x - 4 = 0\n\nPut into the proper form:  x^2 - 6x = 4\nDetermine k:  b = -6 so k = -3\nDetermine k^2:  k = -3 so k^2 = 9\nAdd k^2 to both sides:   x^2 - 6x + 9 = 13\nFactor left hand side:  (x - 3)^2 = 13    this is ALWAYS (x+k)^2\nSquare root:  x-3 = +/- sqrt( 13 )\nSolve for x:    x = 3 +/- sqrt( 13 )\n\n\nFor a more general equation:  a x^2 + b x + c = 0\nFirst divide through by a to get:  x^2 + (b/a) x + (c/a) = 0\nThis is now in the earlier form so use that method will solve it.\n\nGood Luck!,science_mathematics

Therefore, the Y-chromosomes cannot repair ""bad"" mutations. These mutations build up on the Y-chromosome over time. Some of these mutations can cause the Y-chromosome to shorten.

"what does the larynx work with and how?  The larynx (plural larynges), or voicebox, is an organ in the neck of mammals involved in protection of the trachea and sound production. The larynx houses the vocal cords, and is situated at the point where the upper tract splits into the trachea and the esophagus.\n\n\nThe structure of the larynx is mainly composed of cartilage bound by ligaments and muscle. At the front is the thyroid cartilage, creating the prominence of the Adam's apple in humans. The inferior horns (protrusions at the bottom rear of the thyroid cartilage) of the thyroid cartilage rest on a ring-shaped cartilage called the cricoid cartilage which connects the larynx to the trachea. The cricoid cartilage resembles a signet ring (narrow in front, broader in back). Above the larynx is the hyoid bone, by which (via various muscles and ligaments) the larynx is connected to the jaw and skull. These muscles move the larynx during swallowing. The hyoid is the only floating bone in the body; it is not 'attached' to any other bones. The epiglottis is another cartilage that extents upwards behind the back of the tongue and projects down through the hyoid bone. It connects to the thyroid cartilage just beneath the thyroid notch (the Adam's apple).\n\nThe space defined by these main cartilages can be divided roughly into the supraglottis at the top and the glottis.\n\nThe glottis is defined as the space between the vocal folds (more commonly known as vocal cords), which are located at the upper rim of the cricoid cartilage. They attach to the thyroid cartilage at the front, and to the Arytenoid cartilages at the back. These are two roughly tetrahedral cartilages responsible for pulling the vocal folds together and apart (adduction and abduction — see Anatomical terms of location). The glottis is the laryngeal area of most interest to speech researchers, as it is widely believed to be where most of the control of phonation and pitch goes on. The vocal folds are muscular masses coated with a mucous membrane which protects much of the respiratory tract from foreign particles. Their inner edges contain the vocal ligament.\n\nThe supraglottis is that part of the larynx above the glottis. It contains the ventricle of the larynx (laryngeal sinus), the ventricular folds (or false vocal folds), the epiglottis, and the aryepiglottal folds — two folds of connective tissue that connect the epiglottis to the arytenoid cartilages. Muscles in the aryepiglottal folds can pull the leaf-shaped epiglottis down, sealing the larynx and protecting the trachea below from foreign objects.\n\nDuring swallowing, the larynx (at the epiglottis and at the glottis) closes to prevent swallowed material from entering the lungs; there is also a strong cough reflex to protect the lungs. Sensation is transferred by the superior laryngeal nerve (glottis and supraglottis) and the recurrent laryngeal nerve (subglottis and muscles), both branches of the vagus nerve.\n\nWhile articulation of the sound (the fine manipulation that creates the many different vowel and consonant sounds of the world's languages) is achieved by the use of the teeth, tongue, palate, and lips, sound is generated in the larynx, and that is where pitch and volume are manipulated.\n\nThe vocal folds can be held close together (by adducting the arytenoid cartilages), so that they vibrate (see phonation). The muscles attached to the arytenoid cartilages control the degree of opening.\n\nVocal fold length and tension can be controlled by rocking the thyroid cartilage forward and backward on the cricoid cartilage, and by manipulating the tension of the muscles within the vocal folds. This causes the pitch produced during phonation to rise or fall.",science_mathematics
"Should deforestation be allowed in the Amazon River Basin in order to provide for its economic needs? Please Elaborate on Why or Why not... Thanks Unfortunately, the world needs to come to grips with the fact that Brazil will continue to log rain forest in the Amazon and convert land into low-output farm or range lands.  Tropical rainforest soils are very low in nutrients and threir conversion has serious, probably global, consequences.  There seems to be a pretty good consensus about the problem, but it's not just a simple matter of ""big corporations"" (they play their part) and a ruined environment.\n\nBesides the big corporations logging, there are a host of small companies that selectively log the most valuable trees.  This has caused the ""under count"" by many thousands of acres of logged land. (ref. 1)  Often once an area is opened up even in a rudimentary way, subistence ""slash and burn"" farmers follow, often causing large regional fires. (ref. 2) These are very poor, often uneducated, people who see few alternatives to their life style.  Eventualy, the depleted land often ends up in large ranches.  Those who even try to regulate logging do so at considerable risk as the profits from logging and land conversion are huge.(ref. 3).  Last year saw the worst drought in memory in the Amazon, showing that the environment may have reaced a point of no return. (ref.4)\n\nTo this person, there is no easy solution.  Brazil is a poor country where many of the people live on less than $2 a day.  Nobody has the authority to tell them to stop logging other than the Brazilian government, and even then it is doubtful that such a ban could be enforced given the poverty and lawless conditions in the Amazon.  It's like telling the Columbian's to stop growing coca - the US has spent millions on that effort with little effect.  The solution (if there is one) is to end the demand for tropical hardwood, because it's not just Brazil but every tropical forest that is disappearing fast.  This means providing people with an alternate way to make a living.  The developed world needs to spend the money to give the workers in the Amazon (and other extraction-based poor countries) decent life choices that are sustainable along with a stake in a better world.  I invite you to visit the one.org website which discusses their campaign to do just this. (www.one.org).  Actions speak louder than words.

Or killing your enemies out in the wild?  Generally for outdoor survival you don't need to worry about food-you can go many weeks without any food at all, and months with a seriously reduced diet.\nAs far as killing enemies-the most effective means are simple traps based on snares for small animals.  Just set the trip-snare to cause injury.  The most effect sort of injury-inducing trap like this would be something that strikes the head/neck area.

If you have the equipment, even fairly shallow deadfalls with sharpened sticks in the bottom can be debilitating-but you have to lure the person over the deadfall.  The only effective weapons that can be made without a great deal of practice are things such as spears and other throwing weapons.  One fairly effective weapon like this (also used to disable small mammals) is to take two sticks, anywhere from 1-2 inches in diameter, and about 1 foot each-sharpen both ends, and tie them together in an ""X"" shape- With a surprising short amount of practice, this can be quite effective as a hunting tool or weapon.",science_mathematics
"what is water conductivity? what if the reading shows 3.5 Water is not a good conductor of electric current it conducts electric current because of the impurities present in it.\n\nWhy?\n\nWith this simple experiment you can verify that the distilled water presents a very low conductivity because the potential of the first circuit is much less than the developed by the battery. The small potential of this circuit is due to the presence of the H+ and OH- ions produced when some molecules of water are dissociated. However, the number of molecules of water that are dissociated is practically negligible, making the distilled water a weak electrons conductor. It is worth noting, that as the distance among electrodes increases, the resistance to the electrons transfer in the distilled water increases considerably. This fact evidences even more the low conductivity of the distilled water.\n\nWhen salt is added (NaCl) to the system, the conductivity of the system increases considerably. The water not only dissolves the salt, as well as it dissociates the salt molecule. The elementary sodium (Na) presents an excess electron and the chloride (Cl) has a strong affinity for electrons. Consequently, after dissociation, the sodium loses an electron to the chloride, forming Cl- and Na+ ions. The presence of these ions increases the conductivity of the water considerably. The positive ions (Na+) migrate to the negative electrode (linked to the pole - of the battery) and the negatives (Cl-) migrate to the positive electrodes (linked to the pole + of the pile). The conductivity of the aqueous solution water/salt is proportional to the ions concentration in the solution.\nWhen you try to measure the conductivity of tap water you can verify that it has higher conductivity in comparison with distilled water because this contains ions (less pure). The tap water has higher conductivity due to the presence of the ions: Ca2+ and Mg2+. And don´t forget, try the science at home!",science_mathematics

"how to make refined oil from vegetable oil?  I'm guessing you are asking how to make BIODIESEL from vegetable oil. Here is my answer to that:\n\nThe process is quite simple. Alchohol and vegetable oil or some other similar fat are mixed with the catalyst. It can be used animal fats or vegetable oils. The alchohol can be methanol or ethanol. Methanol is generally cheaper since it is made in industrial quantities from petroleum. Sodium hydroxide (aka lye or caustic soda) or potassium hydroxide are mixed in as the catalyst.\n\n1. Methanol and sodium hydroxide are combined making sodium methoxide.\n2. Sodium methoxide is mixed and stirred with vegetable oil (trigycerides). The oil molecules break apart and this produces methylesters and glycerol. The glycerol and catalyst will settle to the bottom as they are both denser than the methylesters. The methylester is drained off after the reaction is complete, about 8 hours.\n3. The methylester (biodiesel) is washed by mixing it with water. The water dissolves any traces of the catalyst and the alchohol. After settling for a few days the water can be drained from the bottom of the tank.\nThe glycerol can be filtered and purified as well. It can be burnt as fuel, or it makes a powerful degreaser (it is already almost soap) and can be made into high quality soap.\n\n*******************************************************\nIf your question is actually how to REFINE CRUDE VEGETABLE OIL into refined vegetable oil, then here are the steps:\n1. Oil extraction from seeds using pressing, solvents, or both (e.g. high quality virgin olive oil is pressed, while lower quality pomace uses solvents to extract)\n2. oil refiining: the crude vegetable oil is mixed with sodium hydroxide which removes the free fatty acids by forming soap\n3. bleaching: this removes pigments by adding a 'bleaching clay' and then filtering the clay\n4. deoderization: this removes volatile compounds and is often done by heating and distillation\n5. fractional crystallization: this is separation of solid fats by allowing the oil to solidify at cooler temperautes\n6. winterization: often some oils must have the fats which solidfy at low room temperatures removed. The oil is cooled and the solids filtered out. \n7. hydrogenation: this binds hydrogen to the unsaturated fatty acids and prevents later oxidation and can be used to make the oil solid\n8. texturing: this is a process where cooled fats are whipped to add some air and improve the texture and appearance, used for shortening\nhttp://www.markets.duke.edu/student_it/soc142_spring2002/team4/sustaining.html",science_mathematics

"How do Cd's work? Additionally what happeneds when you put a CD in the computer? How does the Cd get spun? Compact discs are made from a 1.2 mm thick disc of polycarbonate plastic coated with a much thinner layer of Super Purity Aluminium (or rarely, gold, used for its data longevity, such as in some limited-edition audiophile CDs) layer which is protected by a film of lacquer. The lacquer can be printed with a label. Common printing methods for compact discs are silkscreening and offset printing. \n\nThe information on a standard CD is encoded as a spiral track of pits moulded into the top of the polycarbonate layer. (The areas between pits are known as lands.) Each pit is approximately 100 nm deep by 500 nm wide, and varies from 850 nm to 3.5 μm long. The spacing between the tracks is 1.6 μm. To grasp the scale of the pits and land of a CD, if the disc is enlarged to the size of a stadium, a pit would be approximately the size of a grain of sand. The spiral begins at the center of the disc and proceeds outwards to the edge, which allows the different size formats available.\n\nPits are much closer to the label side of a disc so that defects and dirt on the clear side can be out of focus during playback. Discs are consequently much easier to ruin by scratching the label side, whereas clear-side scratches can be repaired by refilling them with plastic of similar index of refraction.",science_mathematics

"what is ""autocapture"" in geomorphology?  Imagine you have a drainage network of rivers, tributaries, and streams.  Now imagine one particular path of drainage, from head waters to delta.  If somehow (erosion, for example) somewhere along this path the water found a new shortcut to another part of the drainge system, then that water would have been ""autocaptured"".\n\nGet out a map of Illinois and the surrounding area.  The Illinos Waterway goes from Lake Michigan at Chicago to the Mississippi river at St. Louis.  The Mississipi river flows along the western border of Illinois.  Now look at the area between LaSalle, Ill. (on the Waterway) and Davenport, Iowa (by the Mississippi).  There is a set of streams in this area.  If they managed to link together and cause the Mississippi to be diverted near Davenport to LaSalle, then the Illinois Waterway would have captured the Mississippi.  Since these are part of the same drainage system, it would be called an autocapture.\n\nThe link below may explain better with illustrations. Look at pages 9 and 10:\nhttp://www.geography.wisc.edu/classes/geog320/network_and_basin.pdf",science_mathematics

"Hot Water vs Cold Water? If you had 12oz hot water & 12 oz cold water and mixed them together, what actually happens - does the cold water cool down the hot or does the hot heat up the cold? Well,  Hot & Cold are not only subjective (What's Hot for he is cold for me) and relative.  Better to think of temperature.\n\nTemperature is the measure of average kinetic energy.  The hotter, the more energy and vice versa.  \n\nAlso, as temperature is an average, some of the ""hot"" water may be cold.  In fact, there could be a several molecules that are frozen - we'd never know - but the average temperature is ""hot.""\n\nWhen you mix them heat is transfered from the high average kinetic energy water, ""Hot,"" to the low average kinetic energy water, ""Cold.""

"How do electronic diodes work?  Semi-conductor diodes have a non-linear and asymmetric current flow response to applied voltage. Basically they allow much greater current to flow in one direction over the other. It is based on some pretty heavy physics, but can be modeled by considering the junction between N type doped semiconductor and P type doped semiconductor where the majority carriers on one side are positive, and the majority carriers on the other are negative. When you bias the junction in a certain way the carriers on each side of the junction cancel each other out and you get very limited current flow. When you bias the diode the other way the carriers don’t cancel and you get much higher current flow for the same applied voltage.\n\nI assume you don't want to know about vacuum tube diodes of old. They are based on a very different physical property.\n\nHope this helps.",science_mathematics

"why are yawns contagious?  The answer is, no one really knows why yawning is ""contagious"". Or why we yawn at all. One popular explanation is that yawning allows you to get rid of too much carbon dioxide in your system and increase your oxygen supply. This was disproved by Dr. Robert Provine and his research team in 1987.\n\nNow scientists are wondering if yawning is from our deep past -- part of our evolutionary history. Did a yawn signal to the group that it was time for everyone to retire to the trees and snooze? Did a yawn signal that we were all feeling cozy and warm about each other? Did a yawn signal something more like, ""Gee, I know how you're feeling, I feel that way too.""\n\nBetween 40 and 60 percent of the population seems to find yawning contagious. Researchers at the State University of New York conducted a series of yawning experiments. They determined that being self-aware (the ability to recognize oneself) and having the ability to see things from someone else's viewpoint means a person is more likely to find yawning contagious.\n\nNow you're thinking, what humans are not self-aware? Schizophrenics sometimes have trouble with self-recognition so they will not find yawning contagious. Babies won't yawn contagiously until they're more than a year old.\n\nSome birds and reptiles yawn. Most mammals yawn. My dog yawns, but that doesn't make me yawn -- I obviously cannot put myself in her paw prints. (But who can empathize with a creature that sleeps all day, then when she does bother to get up and join you on a walk, suddenly bolts after a squirrel and nearly tears your arm out of your socket? I have no idea what's going on in that dog's mind.)\n\nChimpanzees yawn too, and in fact, if they watch other chimps yawn, they're more likely to yawn too.\n\nSo, I guess the real answer is: who knows?",science_mathematics

I assume that by ""halo stars"" you mean the stars, and globular clusters of stars, that populate a galaxys halo and not the main plane of it. \n\nThe halo stars are first extremely old (as old as the galaxy itself) and that alone would make them poor candidates for finding earthlike planets. They are all off the main sequence except for the smallest stars and have thus evolved to become red giants.\n\nThey are also extremely poor in metals. That means there simply isn´t enough heavy elements to form a planet like earth as it is made of silicates, iron and nickel. \n\nThe globular clusters of the galactic halo seem to have formed from primordial clouds of hydrogen and helium gas.

"What happens when two black holes get too close?  If two bodies (stars, black holes, anything) get close enough to be gravitationally bound they will develop some sort of orbit in which the two bodies circle each other. \n\n\nEinstein's theory of General Relativity predicts that when two very massive objects(like Black Holes and Neutron Stars) are caught in an orbit like this they will generate Gravitational Waves (Ripples in Space-Time). These Gravitational Waves carry energy away from the orbiting bodies which means that with each successive revolution they get closer to each other. Eventually the orbit gets so small that the two bodies merge. \n\n\nThe merger of two black holes entails a lot of complicated General Relativity and some non-intuitive physics, but theorists use large supercomputers to simulate such events. There are two primary results to these mergers of which we can be sure of: \n\n1. A single, more massive black hole \n\n2. An extremely powerful burst of gravitational waves \n\n\nThere are currently projects like LIGO which will attempt to directly detect the disturbances in space time caused by gravitational waves. They primarily expect to ""see"" the results of neutron star and black hole binary mergers. \n\n\nThere was also a recent discovery of a black hole merger in a distant galaxy though this was discovered by observing the jet streams caused by the black holes.

"What causes mechanical energy?  The study of mechanics concerns the motion of physical bodies and the forces that act upon them. Most people are familiar with systems described by Newtonian mechanics - objects that sit around, move, collide, and are influenced by gravity. Mechanical energy includes things like the kinetic energy of a moving billiard ball, or the potential energy a roller coaster at the top of its track.\n\nThe physics of electromagnetism were not understood at the time of Newton, but in some situations, the mechanics (i.e. the mathematics of motion) of bodies influenced by electromagnetic forces is the same as that of those influenced by gravity. For example, two particles of opposite electrical charge experience an attractive force which is (allowing for certain idealizations) mathematically identical to the gravitational forces two passing planets experience. An electromechanical system might also involve the conversion of mechanical energy into electrical charges or magnetic fields, or vice versa.\n\nEveryday objects are composed of atoms and molecules, which to some degree, are like billiard balls that are constantly bouncing off one another. ""Mechanical energy"" might include the kinetic energy of these particles, or potential energy stored in the physical arrangement. For example, a compressed solid exerts pressure because electromagnetic forces between particles tend to push them apart. Compressing a solid (moving the particles ""uphill"" against repulsive electromagnetic forces) stores potential energy in a similar way that pushing a boulder up a hill does (moving the object uphill against the attractive gravitational force of the Earth). On the other hand, a compressed gas exerts pressure because independently moving particles collide with the walls of the container and change direction. The particle is accelerated (its velocity vector changed), and the acceleration times the mass of the particle gives the force applied. Compressing a gas changes the average kinetic energy of the particles, which is reflected in the corresponding increase in the temperature of the gas. The pressure also increases, but this is because the same number of particles have been forced into a smaller volume, so they collide more often with the walls. The force of any given collision is the same, but the number of collisions has increased.\n\nPotential energy does play a role in the pressure of a gas. During an individual collision, a gas molecule comes closer to the molecules of the container wall. The electric fields exert a force on the molecule, slowing it down and reducing its kinetic energy. This energy is temporarily stored as potential energy. Soon, the particle is nearly stationary (if it happened to approach head on), or at least, it is not approaching the wall any more. The electric fields continue to exert a force on the gas molecule. The force continues to change the velocity, and soon the molecule is moving away from the wall and gaining kinetic energy. Generally, the collision is elastic, and all of the kinetic energy is recovered and the particle continues moving with the same speed it had originally.\n\nSolid mechanics studies how rigid bodies behave in response to external forces. Fluid mechanics studies the internal motion of liquids, gases, and other forms of matter. Mechanical energy can be expended in crushing a soda can, affecting the motion and positional arrangement of its component reioufdgkljh kjhfbkjh ael;hgfljh wajh kjfrom the molecules of a solid to the molecules of a liquid when, for example, a glass of water is stirred.\n\nYou could get more information from the link below...",science_mathematics
"How to prove 1+1=2? How? There is a set of mathematical rules that are in place that do not have proofs.  They are postulates.  They are thoughts that are accepted as true, because everything beyond that is based off it.\n\nThe base 10 numbering system has a set of rules in place (as does other numbering systems)  They dont need proof because the rules that govern the system are part of the system itself.  for example, in base 2 system (or binary) it is a postulate that 1+1=10 for base 16, it is a postulate that 1+1=2 and 9+1=A\n\nProving for a base 10 system that 1+1=2 is like asking someone to prove that a minimum of two points are needed to make a line.

"Periodic Table Element Help? hi\nI am researching and doing a project on the NOBLE GASES and I have 3 questions about them. Answers dont have to be long...just enough so I can understand & learn them.\n\n1.) WHY do the members of this family have similar properties?\n\n2.) WHAT are the similar properites?\n\n3.) HOW does this family tend to bond with other chemicals?\n\n(PS: i think #1 has something to do with ""valence electrons"" and #3 has something to do with ""ionic"" or ""covalent""\n\nThanks 4 the Help! \nmuch appreciated 1. All the members of the noble gases have a full shell of valence electrons, so they don't easily bond with other atoms.\n\n2. Because of the full shell, the noble gases have very weak intermolecular forces (IMF's), so they all have very low melting and boiling points. Helium actually doesn't become a liquid at normal atmospheric pressure until you get down to 4.22 K (-452 degrees Fahrenheit).\n\n3. They don't. Well, not usually. The larger noble gases (Krypton and Xenon) will bond with others, but only when using an expanded octet, in the d orbital. This makes compounds such as xenon tetrafluoride, XeF4. However, Helium and Neon will not react with anything, as their ionization energy is extremely high and their electron affinity is very low.\n\nNOTE: The answers above me are WRONG. Noble gases definitely do not form diatomic compounds. They are confusing the noble gases with the halogens, the elements that are in the second to the right column on the periodic table. It took all the way until 1962 for a chemist to synthesize a true noble gas compound, Xe[PtF6]- (xenon hexafluoroplatinate).\n\nEDIT: Tarangoyal, I'm reporting you for plagiarism.

"Why does salt lower the freezing point of water? Why does salt lowers the freezing point of water? can someone explain it to me in deatail? thx alot! When you add a salt to water and the container feels cold, yes, an endothermic reaction is taking place.  The solution is grabbing heat from the surroundings to get the salt to dissolve.  When you add a salt to a pure solvent (say, water), the freezing point will go down and the boiling point will go up.  That's because the vapor pressure of the pure solvent is lowered (this would be easier to explain with a phase diagram).  Remember, the definition of BP is the temp at which the solution's vapor pressure equals the external pressure.  By lowering the vapor pressure, the whole phase diagram shifts...BP to the right (higher), FP to the left (lower).  You may want to check out a intro level chemistry text or at least draw out the phase diagram to see more clearly what gets lost is just words here.  Did you ever try boiling water without heating it?  If you have the means, hook up a vacuum to a flask of water.  You don't change the vapor pressure of the water, but you reduce the external pressure enough so that the water does boil.\n\nOne more thing...  The change in BP and FP is related to how much salt is added to the solvent:  delta T (change in T) = Km  where K is either what's called the molal freezing-point depression constant or molal boiling-point elevation constant;  m is the molality of the solution defined as moles of solute (salt) / kilograms of solvent. By knowing the constant for the solvent, how much solvent you have and how much solute you add, you can predict by how much (in degrees (C) the BP or FP will change.\n\nI would just like to add a couple of more comments... The reaction that is endothermic in this case is  NaCl(s) --> Na+(aq) + Cl-(aq)  ...  The reason that the freezing point is lowered is as J. Schultz said - the vapor pressure is lowered ....  However there is a simple analogy (that may be useful) which gives a simplified picture ... Freezing involves the water molecules becoming very ordered in crystalline lattice...  However when there are foreign particles such as Na+ and Cl- ions in the water they hinder the formation of the crystalline structure because they interfere with the intermolecular forces between the water molecules.  Also, the freezing point depression and boiling point elevation are called colligative properties...  that is, they are properties that depend only on the number of solute particles and not on their chemical properties...  The third famous colligative property is osmotic pressure.",science_mathematics
"who's invented tel scope?  No one really knows.

The theory in question here is that of tunneling.  Tunneling states that there is a non-zero probability of a particle passing through an energy barrier without going over it.  In essence, it's like the particle simply passed through the barrier.  Now, in theory, were you to try an infinite number of times, it is possible that at the instant that every particle in your body hit the wall, they would all quantum mechanically tunnel through the barrier.  It's so exceedingly unlikely though, that for all intents and purposes, it's impossible.  \n\nQuantum mechanics is filled with little things like that.

"How does touching thek nob of a positively charged electroscope with a finger discharge the electroscope?  basic answer: if the scope is charged, that means there are an excess of like charges all stuck together. like carges repel, but they have nowhere to go since there are no conductors around. you're body, mostly water, is a decent conductor, so when you touch it, the charges are free to move farther apart from each other by going into your body. the charges leave the scope until the excess charge is neutralized.\n\nmore accurate: actually, positive charges don't move, since positive protons are stuck in the atoms, but negative electrons are free to move in a conductor. when something is positively charged, it didnt gain positive charge, but lost electrons. when you neutralize it, electrons flow FROM your body to the scope. this is really the same as a net positive charge leaving the scope, but that isnt whats actually happening at an atomic level",science_mathematics

"What is the difference between inertial and gravitational acceleration.?  Your question can be answered with the following quote.  Basically the difference is in the fact that gravitational acceleration is proporationally the the two objects being studied, whereas inertial aceleration refers cheifly to a single object being accelerated without regard to another mass.\n\nQuestion\n\nWhat is the difference between the inertial and gravitational mass?\n\nAsked by: Raminder\n\nAnswer\n\n1) Inertial mass. This is mainly defined by Newton's law, the all-too-famous F = ma, which states that when a force F is applied to an object, it will accelerate proportionally, and that constant of proportion is the mass of that object. In very concrete terms, to determine the inertial mass, you apply a force of F Newtons to an object, measure the acceleration in m/s2, and F/a will give you the inertial mass m in kilograms. \n\n2) Gravitational mass. This is defined by the force of gravitation, which states that there is a gravitational force between any pair of objects, which is given by \n\nF = G m1 m2/r2 \n\nwhere G is the universal gravitational constant, m1 and m2 are the masses of the two objects, and r is the distance between them. This, in effect defines the gravitational mass of an object. \n\nAs it turns out, these two masses are equal to each other as far as we can measure. Also, the equivalence of these two masses is why all objects fall at the same rate on earth.",science_mathematics

"What makes lobsters turn red? I know it has something to do with chemistry and/or physics and I once knew but now can't remember. Please, please, please no dumb answers. After multiple volunteers and a bit of research, I found the answer, and found it to be pretty simple. In the words of the Northeastern Fisheries Science Centre, ""The red pigment is the most stable component of the colouring in a lobster shell. The greens and browns which darken the shell in a live lobster are destroyed by cooking."" For a more complete answer I did some further digging and found that the red pigment common to all decapod (shrimp, prawn, crab, lobster) exoskeletons (shells) is letons (shells) is astaxanthin, a carotenoid (like b-carotene, the pigment that makes fruits red-orange) found in many organisms from bacteria to birds. Astaxanthin was first identified in the exoskeletons of crayfish, Astacidea, hence its name. In lobsters, as in many decapods, astaxanthin is not a free pigment, but is complexed with a protein called a -crustacyanin, which alters the resonance of astaxanthin such that the complex acts as a blue-green pigment. As mentioned above, astaxanthin is heat stable, while the a-crustacyanin protein is not, so boiling the lobster shell denatures the blue-green a-crustacyanin releasing the red-orange astaxanthin.",science_mathematics

Either one can equal zero, so you have different solutions that work.\n\nTake 2x:\n2x=0\nx=0\n\nNow x+3:\nx+3=0\nx=-3\nSo\nx=0,-3\n\n\nHere we have to ""factor"" this equation:  Find two things that, when multiplied together, equal this.  y^2 and 8y both have y, so factor out the y and get:\ny(y+8) \nWe can do as we did before, and get\ny=0\nand \ny+8=0, so\ny=-8\nOur answers are\ny=0,-8\n\nThe next two are harder:\n\nFirst bring the 28 over to the other side:\n\nx^2+3x-28=0  \n\nThe factored form of this actually has two factors, but none with just x.  To factor this, we need two factors of -28.  When one of them is multiplied by x and added to the other one multiplied by x, they equal 3x.  Now, a negative times a positive is a negative so we are looking for one positive and one negative factor of 28.  Let's try these two:\n\n7 and -4.\n7(-4)=-28\n7x+(-4x) = 7x-4x=3x!\n\n-4 and 7 are our factors, so:\n(x+7)(x-4) is our factored form.  Solve the components:\nx+7=0\nx=-7\n\nx-4=0\nx=4\n\n x=-7,4 are our two answers.\n\n\n\n2x^2+9x-5\n\n\nThe next one is similar, but more complicated.  We have a 2x^2.  No matter.  We need to find two factors of -5, and one of them will be multiplied by 2x instead of x.  The only factors of -5 are +/-1, and +/-5.  It looks like the 5 will be positive since 9x is fairly big and positive.  Let's try -1 and 5:\n2x(5)=10x\nx(-1)=-x\n10x+(-x)= 10x-x=9x!\n\nSo 2x will be multiplied by 5, and x by -1.  In factored form, this is:\n\n (2x-1)(x+5)\n\nBecause you use FOIL (first outside, inside last) so the 2x is not multiplied by -1, but by 5.  Now solve these components.\n\n2x-1=0\n2x=1\nx=1/2\n\nx+5=0\nx=-5\nSo\n x=1/2, -5 are our two answers. \n\nAll done.  Hope this helps.",science_mathematics

"Our brain is made of how many nerves? How many nerves are there in our brain? The brain tissue surrounding the ventricles is far from homogeneous, but can be separated into a number of connected but distinct parts. It is dominated by the massive cerebrum, or forebrain, divided neatly down its mid-line into two almost mirror-image halves, linked by a massive band of nerves, the corpus callosum. Below the cerebral hemispheres lie the mid- and hind-brains. For the first 3-4 mm below the wrinkled surface of the cerebrum the tissue is coloured pinkish grey, forming the cortex (meaning “bark”); below that, it is yellowish white. The colour of the cortex is due to its extremely rich blood supply—fully 20 per cent of circulating blood goes to supply the brain. By contrast the “white matter” is so because of the fatty sheaths, composed largely of myelin, which insulate the nerves packed inside. The geography of the cerebral cortex, defined by its ridges and clefts (sulci and gyri) provides a distinction between left and right, frontal and occipital lobes. The regions towards the mid-line are medial, towards the sides temporal, the top, dorsal, and the bottom, ventral.\n\nBehind the cerebrum lies the even more wrinkled and folded cerebellum (“little brain”) covered with its own cortex. Visible as the brain is dissected are a number of distinct structures named by the anatomists after their fancied resemblance to other natural forms—the hippocampus (seahorse), amygdala (almond), pons (bridge), medulla, and many more. Running down from the medulla and through the spine is the spinal cord, carrying nerves to (afferent) and from (efferent) the brain itself. Nerves to and from the eyes (optic), nose (olfactory), and also cranial nerves to other regions of the head run directly into the brain, not via the spinal cord. Together, brain and spinal cord form the central nervous system (CNS), to distinguish them from the nerves that connect the brain and cord with the rest of the body, called the peripheral nervous system. Because of the bilateral symmetry of the brain, each of the structures within it seemed to the early anatomists to be duplicated, one to the left and one to the right. The exception seemed to be the pineal gland, located in the centre of the brain, and it was in part because of this that Descartes, whose dualist philosophy firmly separated the human soul from the mere clockwork processes that ran the rest of the body, decided that the pineal must be the site at which the soul or mind interacted with and drove the body forward. Non-human animals, which were believed not to possess souls, he saw as entirely machine-like.\nThe current view of the brain is of an organ composed of a large number of substructures, each densely packed with neurons and their surrounding glia. Within each nucleus, and within the cerebral and cerebellar cortices, neurons are of three general types: some receive inputs from either sense organs or other brain regions; others (projection or pyramidal neurons) transmit signals out of the region, down long axons to other brain regions or, via the spinal cord or cranial nerves to the periphery. The third and much the most numerous class are the spiny or stellate interneurons, which communicate only within a particular nucleus or cortex, either with one another or with the afferent and efferent neurons.\n\nFor modern localizers, these different substructures are regarded as “centres” for particular brain functions. Of particular importance are a group of connected nuclei including the hypothalamus, hippocampus, some nuclei of the thalamus, and the amygdala, sometimes grouped together as the limbic system. These centres are particularly relevant in the context of emotion, sexual drive, hunger, and thirst, and damage to them can have profound effects. The hypothalamus also has direct neural connections with the pituitary gland at the base of the brain, the source for many important regulatory hormones, and hypothalamic-pituitary feedback processes provide a key site for ",science_mathematics
"Is Cristal cave in Oklahoma USA natural? What are the evidences? ...the rock is very hard, and there's no traces of water. How it's formed? I think it's not natural) This is a very common name for caves, so it is hard to be certain of which Crystal Cave you are asking about. There is a Crystal Cave near Cherokee County that is part of a cave preserve that is most certainly a natural cave. It is gated and locked and not open to the public as far as I know. I can find no references to a ""Cristal"" Cave. \n\nIt is not uncommon for a cave to have formed during a period of time many thousands or even millions of years ago when the climate of a the area was much different than it is today. For example, during the Eocene about 38 million years ago the area where Oklahoma is now had a paratropical climate. (see: http://www.scotese.com/earlyeoc1.htm)\nThere are many caves in desert climates that formed long before the area became a desert. Consider some of the spectacular caves in southern Arizona such as Kartchner Caverns:\nhttp://www.pr.state.az.us/Parks/parkhtml/kartchner.html\n\nIn the northwest part of Oklahoma there are many caves formed in gypsum. In other parts of the state there are caves in limestone. The hardness of the rock has nothing to do with the formation of a cave. In both limestone and gypsum, caves are formed by dissolution of the rock by water. In limestone caves this process is aided by carbonic acid which forms in overlying soil when rainfall dissolved carbon dioxide. This acidic water attacks the limestone and forms caves.  Limestone frequently has fractures and joints within the rock that are the initial paths of water flow, and as these enlarge they form connected paths that often grow into a cave. If the process goes on for enough time, the limestone dissolves away completely. However, in many cases the cave forms and then climatic changes or changes such as geologic uplift bring cave formation to a halt. The cave is preserved and is no longer actively forming. \n\nTo see some more informatin about cave formation:\nhttp://www.speleogenesis.info/\n\nHere is an animation that illustrates perfectly how a cave can form and then become dry:\nhttp://www.classzone.com/books/earth_science/terc/content/visualizations/es1405/es1405page01.cfm?chapter_no=visualization",science_mathematics
"why video signal is frequency modulated in satellite communication?  Satellites use non-linear amplifiers to relay signals back to earth.  Using AM for any type of transmission through the satellite would heavily distort the AM signal and make the signal have very poor quality.\n\nVideo, or more accurately TV signals used to be exclusively distributed via satellite using FM because of its constant envelope characteristic made them largely impervious to the amplitude distortions caused by the non-linear amplification of the satellite.  \n\nHowever, increasingly more video (TV) transmissions are using digital transmission schemes.  Here the baseband TV signal is digitized into some bit format and the bits are used to phase-modulate (PM) the carrier. When PM is digitally modulated it is known as Phase Shift Keying or PSK. This also has a constant envelope characteristic like FM and PM making it suitable for the non-linear amplification of the satellite.\n\nSatellite amplifiers are becoming more and more powerful as the technology improves.  They also are becoming more linearized.  This is allowing digital transmissions to utilize a combination PSK and AM technique known as APSK or sometimes, QAM (Quadrature Amplitude Modulation).  Using these techniques requires the satellite amplifiers to be used at much less than their full power, so they are linear and do not cause large amplitude distortions.  This is done because these newer techniques allow more bits/sec to be transmitted on the satellite channel.

"Why does the moon have phases?  One of the biggest misconceptions about the Moon is that its phases are caused by the Earth's shadow. The Earth's shadow causes eclipses, but it has nothing to do with phases. Rather, the phases of the Moon are produced by the alignment of the Moon and the Sun in the sky. \nThe orientation of Sun and Moon determines the phase of the Moon. At new moon, the angular distance of the sun and moon is small, less than a few degrees. At first quarter, when the moon is half full, the Moon lies 90 degrees east of the Sun. As an example, if you were to point to the setting sun with one arm and to the moon with the other, the angle between your arms would be 90 degrees. At full, the moon is 180 degrees from the sun and at last quarter, it is 90 degrees west of the sun. \n \n\nThe new moon is essentially invisible because it is between the earth and sun and therefore lost in the glare of the sun. Even on day 2 or 3 it is tough to spot the moon because it is just the tiniest sliver and still very close to the sun. The waxing crescent moon grows till it is about half full in the phase we call first quarter. From there it grows to full moon and then begins to shrink back to third quarter, waning crescent and finally back to new moon. \n\nThe first and last quarter moons mark the halfway points between the new moon and full moon. The first quarter moon is illuminated on the right hand side. The last quarter moon is illuminated on the left hand side. It seems conflicting to call a half full moon first of last quarter, but the quarter refers to the position of the moon in the sky, not it's phase. A quarter moon is one quarter of a full circle (90 degrees) away from the sun. \n\nThe lighted part of the Moon always points the way to the Sun. This means that a waxing crescent moon in the western sky at sunset has the lighted part on the right which is the direction of the Sun. The sequence of the lunar phases always proceeds with the lighted part of the Moon growing from right to left until the moon reaches full. After full moon, the light recedes from right to left until new moon. \n\nThe line boundary between dark and light on the Moon is called the terminator. It is rarely an even line because the surface of the Moon is not smooth. The terminator is closest to a straight line at first and last quarter. Librations affect exactly what portion of the face of the Moon is facing the Earth, during first and last quarter phase, the terminator's exact location may vary. This is illustrated when the terminator does not line up with the Moon's meridian at first and last quarter. In other words, you'd think that during first and last quarter when the Moon is half full, that the meridian (the imaginary line which runs from north to south on the Moon,) would be right on the terminator, but it isn't so. In fact the terminator can be almost 8 degrees off to either side of the meridian.",science_mathematics

"Does a one month old baby reognze people/thngs?  The concept of recognition is that of relating to past perceptions.  The brain is functional even in the womb, but it learns/perceives via the senses mostly after the birth.  If a baby sees a thing twice, it may recognize the thing, but if it sees people/things for the first time, it will just be a first-time perception for the baby, recorded by its brain.  Moreover, just as we sometimes forget (or remember), the baby's brain too can forget (or remember).  So, it might or might not recognize things or people.  It all depends on the depth of perception and retention of that perception.\n\nThere is a theory in some religions regarding rebirth, that when a soul is reborn in a body, it carries part/whole of its perceptions, knowledge, etc. from its previous birth.  In other words, a part or whole of the mind and person is reborn into a new body.  As such, even a one-month old baby also may recognize with ease and expertise, but we do not have enough data to prove this scientifically.",science_mathematics

When you compress the spring, you distort the lattices of the crystals that make it up.

"On evolution - Maybe you can ineract about this? I believe that science have a way of answering questions in life, not just physical but also those which pertains to life and belief.\n\nThese are my questions regarding evolution:\n\n1. The first question is that do you believe in evolution?\n\n2. Next, if you believe in evolution, do you also believe in the Bible (eventhough you may not exactly believe in God - like non-christian beliefs)? -- Why not? You might have read other books and thinks that their contents are believable.\n\n3. Now this is my final question and postulate:\n\nIf you believe in the Bible therefore you believe in the ""Great Flood""? (almost 4,000 years ago - according to the bible)\n\nThus, this great catastrophe would have destroyed every living things in earth that are not capable of breathing in water, save the family of Noah and only those creatures that were inside the Arc.\n\nThese would have refuted evolution since after that point of time only selected few lives were saved and there would have been a great extinction. That response from gimpalomg was kinda disrespectful. Evolution is a waste of time. It tries to disprove something that cannot be disproved. Evolution is baseless, unfounded and a big scientific hoax to sway believers into thinking that science answers such questions. Evolution is circular reason. You say the earth couldn't possibly be 10000 years old max, I ask why, u'd probably bring up some evolution based theory that attemot to explain away the truth, which is the bible, but for now, I won't be forcing those doctrines down ur throat =D. \n\nThibnk about the bible for a second. The flood would explain so many things that science fails to answer such as the extinction of dinasuars, they're too big to fit on an arc.  Bare in mind that dinasuars are simply reptiles we see tody except that everything had the ability to live longer, if you want to explore that theory look it up because I promised not to use circular reasoning. the flood would explain why fish remains are ound on every mountain peak. It would explain why there was a ""nomadic"" time period in that time. And sooo obvious to us, it would explain what the heck a huuuge arc is doing on mount Ararat, which by the way was picke dup by NASA satellites. It should be noted that the bible states that Noah's arc rested atop mount Ararat. \n\nLastly, Evolution should not be in text books. The theory is warped an d blown aout of proprtion. I believe there are six major theories that compose the entire science of evolution. Only 1 uno theory hasbeen proved. That theory is microevolution which states that some organisms have the power to make themselves evolve MINOR CHANGES i.e Darwin's discovery of natural selection (longer beaks vs. shorter beaks etc.). This is GREAT, sure, except that the other theories cannot be proven but some have been disproven, there's something they don't always include in text books. Macroevolution which is the level above Microevolution comprises of the theory that species make huge changes over time such as extra limbs, DNA changes etc, again, not proven, even disproven by ""vestigial"" organs... aren't we supposed to evolve by GAINING other parts, not losing them. Buut scioentiest insist on using vestigial organs as the tailbone... guess WHAT ppl, it's not vestigial; you try walking around without it then try calling ir vestigial ,it serves a purpose. &#92;\n\non to the whole age thing. The earth is more likely to be 10000 years max than millions. According to the evolutionary theory, dinasuars became extinct MILLIONS of years ago. How much time does it take for flesh to decompose? I'm thinking FAR less than a million years. Why then are red blood cells still being found in dinasuar remains? The best answer is that the earth could NEVER be nearly as old as we think it is. I also want to point out thaT the earth is usually dated by ratioactive dating, which, in itself, is VERY unreliable. Research Radioactive dating accuracy and find the fact. The dates are beyond the level of being off, scientists know this. All they do is find a formula which is closest to the actual date even if it is millions of years inaccurate. Don't believe me? Research it yourself. \n\nEvolution is something that has been put in textbooks to simply explain away religious doctrines they feel are impossible. If you do your research like I did, you will easly see that evolution is no more true than Roman mythology\n\nAnd one dangerous thing we seem to be doing. The bible is NOT all symbolic.  That is REALLY dangerous. If i told u that the wings of the eagle stretched far beyond my reach then went on to recap yesterdays events, would you beleive that all of what I said was symbolic.

Omitting the reaction NH3(g) = NH3(aq), we have:\n\nNH3 (aq) + H2O (L) = NH4+(aq) + OH-(aq)\n\nThe equilibrium constant for this reaction is:\n\nKb = [NH4+]*[OH-]/[NH3]\n\nThe hydroxide produced in this reaction reacts with the manganese ion to form insoluble manganese hydroxide (Ksp ~ 2*10^-13)\n\nMn++(aq) + 2OH-(aq) = Mn(OH)2(s)\n\nThe equilibrium constant for this reaction is:\n\nK = 1/Ksp = 1/([Mn++]*[OH-]^2) \n\nThe reaction you wrote is the sum of 2 times the first reaction plus the second reacton.  Note that as written, the first reaction produces OH- ions while the second one consumes them.  \n\nIf we add an acid like HNO3 to the solution, we are adding H+ ions.  Adding H+ ions is really like subtracting OH- ions because the concentrations of H+ and OH- are inversely proportional to one another through the water dissociation reaction (H2O = H+ + OH-, [H+]*[OH-] = Kw = 10^-14).\n\nWe can therefore write the two equilbrium constants above in terms of the concentration of H+ instead of OH-:\n\nKb = [NH4+]*[OH-]/[NH3] = Kw*[NH4+]/([NH3]*[H+])\n\nK = 1/([Mn++]*[OH-]^2) = ([H+]^2)/(Kw^2 * [Mn++])\n\nThis means that if we add acid (i.e., HNO3) to the solution, we will drive the first reaction in the forward direction; the concentration NH4+ will increase and the concentration of NH3(aq) will decrease.  Adding H+ will drive the second reaction in the reverse direction; Mn(OH)2(s) will dissolve, and the concentration of Mn++ will increase.",science_mathematics
"Why do so many drug names end in 'HCL'? For example, Zyrtec=cetirizine HCL\n\nIsn't HCL Hydrochloric Acid? Is this some kind of binder to hold ingredients together? I'm just curious as I see this on commercials all the time. A previous answerer almost got it right.  Many drugs are practically insoluble in water, yet they are basic.  Such drugs, being bases, can react with acids to form salts.  These salts, if properly chosen, can be quite water soluble.  Very commonly, salts formed by reacting bases with hydrogen chloride or hydrochloric acid (HCl) are quite water soluble.  It is often important to have good water solubility in a drug to aid its dissolution in the stomach or to make it appropriate for percutaneous (injection, intravenous, etc.) use.  These hydrochloride salts are designated by listing ""HCl"" after the drug name.",science_mathematics

Would that mean life would begin over again or for the first time? Oooooh what a cool question... more philosophical than scientific in my opinion.\n\nI think you're right in theory.  If there is only one time line then stopping humans (and everything) from evolving (which would take quite the disaster) would mean that our time traveler (assuming he's human) would have never existed and he could never have stopped evolution... it's an infinate loop really, or impossible.  A lot of people say that if time travel is possible, it's only possible in forward time.  Although there are ideas about multiple universes and looping time, and parallel timelines that can explain things like this and Donnie Darko. Haha, fun question.\n\n\n\n\nVeck.  First of all it's more a question about time travel than evolution.\n\nSecond evolution definately has NOT been abandonded by the scientific community.

I thought if I knew how to get angles i may be able to cut trim properly with a miter saw. Thank You. Here are several answers - you didn't specify baseboard or ceiling trim. Each is cut differently. The easiest way to cut ceiling trim is to first rip cut (lengthwise) a 12 or 18 inch piece of 2x4. Place that in your miter box with the slope facing you and rising toward you. You'll need to clamp this for safety. Now place your trim here and make the cut. This way you won't need the fancy math to figure compound angles.\n\nTwo tips for base trim...if it's only slightly open, you can choose to use the round shaft of a screw driver to roll over the joint at a slight angle. This will deform the wood slightly and close the gap. Pre-apply glue, if you wish and tape together until the glue dries. Alternatively, if the joint is close but not 'good enough' use one or more playing cards as spacers. If the joint is open, place the cards away from the cut. If the joint is tight, place cards near the cut.",science_mathematics

There are several other mnemonics for these types of logs, depending on the company who is logging the well. These include FMI and FMS (Schlumberger), EMI (Halliburton), HMI, OBMI (Schlumberger), STAR (Baker Atlas), CAST, UBI (Shlumberger),FMS, EarthImager (Baker Atlas), and FAC-40. They are generically referred to as electrical borehole images and are essentially sophisticated dipmeter logs. It is a map of the shallow resistivity. Both UBI and OBMI are Schlumberger logs for application in oil-base mud. Schlumberger’s product brochure is here (link to pdf):\n\nhttp://www.slb.com/media/services/evaluation/geology/obmi.pdf\n\nA good introduction is in “Basic Well Log Analysis” by George Asquith and Daniel Krygowski published by AAPG. ISBN 0891816674  If you can’t find this in your library you can get it from AAPG directly (the link is below) and by joining AAPG can get a discount on books. \n\nIn my experience using these logs I have found them incredibly useful for detailed facies analysis, yielding detailed information such as paleoflow direction. Baker Atlas in Houston has a team that is dedicated to this type of depositional analysis. Another excellent application for these logs is in fracture analysis. It is possible to determine frequency and orientation of macro-fractures and use them for directional drilling or other applications such as reservoir evaluation. My experience with oil-based mud image logs has been that they are not as good as water-based logs, however, when oil-base mud is needed, the quality of the image log is not likely to be a priority. Another difficulty you will encounter researching these logs is that they are almost never in the public domain. Unlike common logs such as Gamma Ray and Resistivity, these logs are not required to be turned over to the state (in the US) so they remain locked up in oil company libraries and are not shared with the common suppliers of well logs such as A2D and IHS Energy. In some countries this may be different, but because these logs are expensive to produce they have not been used in many places.   \n\nTo find detailed information I suggest using GeoRef.

"Bacteria containing Cellulase? Hey,\nWhat kinds of bacteria, algae, or fungi can be found in wood which have the enzyme cellulase in them? All help is greatly appreciated. Wood-boring bivalves of the family Teredinidae (commonly called shipworms) are known to harbor dense populations of gram-negative bacteria within specialized cells (bacteriocytes) in their gills. These symbionts are thought to provide enzymes, e.g., cellulase and dinitrogenase, which assist the host in utilizing wood as a primary food source. A cellulolytic, dinitrogen-fixing bacterium, Teredinibacter turnerae, has been isolated from the gill tissues of numerous teredinid bivalves and has been proposed to constitute the sole or predominant symbiont of this bivalve family. Here we demonstrate that one teredinid species, Lyrodus pedicellatus, contains at least four distinct bacterial 16S rRNA types within its gill bacteriocytes, one of which is identical to that of T. turnerae. Phylogenetic analyses indicate that the three newly detected ribotypes are derived from gamma proteobacteria that are related to but distinct (>6.5% sequence divergence) from T. turnerae. In situ hybridizations with 16S rRNA-directed probes demonstrated that the pattern of occurrence of symbiont ribotypes within bacteriocytes was predictable and specific, with some bacteriocytes containing two symbiont ribotypes. However, only two of the six possible pairwise combinations of the four ribotypes were observed to cooccur within the same host cells. The results presented here are consistent with the existence of a complex multiple symbiosis in this shipworm species.",science_mathematics

Gene Cernan was actually the last person to be on the Moon because Jack Schmitt climbed back up into the Lunar Module first leaving Gene Cernan still on the surface.

"why are e1 reactions generally not used to synthesize alkenes ?  I don't know if this is what you're looking for but... E1 reactions are caused by the solvent pulling off the leaving group, thus a carbo-cation is produced. The leaves the door open for rearrangement of the carbon skeleton, you'll often see alkyl and hydride shifts in the intermediate (carbons and hydrogens moving around to stabilize the atom). E1 is usually preformed in reflux conditions (boiling point of the solvent), which also makes carbon rearrangement more likely. E1 is also in competition with Sn1 (which isn't an elimination at all), so you'll get rearmaments at chiral centers, alkyl halides, and other trash. So E1 kinda messes with your product. \n\nBut, your other option, E2, requires antiperiplanar geometry when removing the other hydrogen, so rings are a whole mess by themselves. And E2 is not great for removing OH groups, you usually have to protonate the OH (usually with acid) and make an oxonium ion (positive oxygen) and get the OH to leave as H2O, which is an E1 mechanism.

"What's in semen?  IN SEMEN :\nApproximately 200- to 500-million spermatozoa (also called sperm or spermatozoans), produced in the testes, are released per ejaculation. However, they make up only about 2–5% of the volume of semen. The bulk of the semen is composed of seminal plasma, the fluid portion of semen. This fluid is contributed by the accessory male reproductive organs. Some 60% of the volume of ejaculate is produced by the seminal vesicles, and most of the remainder is generated by the prostate. A small amount of viscous mucus secreted by the bulbourethral glands contributes to the cohesive jelly-like texture of semen.\n\nSeminal plasma of humans contains a complex range of organic and inorganic constituents. They include metal and salt ions, sugars, lipids, steroid hormones, enzymes, prostaglandin hormones, amino acids and basic amines. The seminal plasma provides a nutritive and protective medium for the spermatozoa during their journey through the female reproductive tract. The normal environment of the vagina is a hostile one for sperm cells, as it is very acidic (from the native microflora producing lactic acid), viscous, and patrolled by immune cells. The components in the seminal plasma attempt to compensate for this hostile environment.\n\nBasic amines such as putrescine, spermine, spermidine and cadaverine are responsible for the smell and flavor of semen. These alkaline bases counteract the acidic environment of the vaginal canal (which is harmful to sperm), and protect DNA inside the sperm from acidic denaturation. Salts and metal ions in the semen help to create a more hospitable environment for the sperm in the vaginal canal. A typical ejaculation can contain up to 5 mg of zinc. Zinc serves to help to stabilize the DNA-containing chromatin in the sperm cells. A zinc deficiency may result in lowered fertility because of increased sperm fragility. Zinc deficiency can also adversely affect spermatogenesis.\n\nThe simple sugar fructose is the main energy source of sperm cells, which rely entirely on sugars from the seminal plasma for energy. Other components of semen (mucus and texturizing proteins) serve to increase the mobility of sperm cells in the vagina and cervix by creating a less viscous channel for the sperm cells to swim through, and preventing their diffusion out of the semen. Prostaglandin hormones are involved in suppressing an immune response by the female against the foreign semen.",science_mathematics

It is now more apparent than ever, that bad choices in the past, due to economics, are plaguing the only planet that we can call home right now.  Therefore, we must reassert that we are not only a part of a nature but realize the power that we have and work towards the world of tomorrow.

"They say oyster increases man's libido. Why or how?  ""Aphrodisiacs are substances that arouse sexual desire or enhance sexual performance. For many centuries there has been a search for substances that could increase a person's sexual powers or desire. \n\nAmong the many substances that have been claimed to have such an effect are oysters, ginseng root, powdered rhinoceros horn, animal testicles, and turtles' eggs. There is no evidence that an actual aphrodisiac response occurs with these or any other substances.\n\nJust how certain foods or other substances come to be seen as aphrodisiacs is typically a matter of folklore rather than fact. In some cases the newness or rarity of a food or chemical invite people to endow it with magical powers of a sexual nature.\n\nIn other instances, sexual strength is assumed to come from eating foods resembling a sex organ, such as bananas and oysters because of their vague resemblance to the penis and testicles. While the notion that the shape of an unrelated object should qualify it as an aphrodisiac seems absurd to most, people continue to view some foods as aphrodisiacs.\n\nAre Oysters Really an Aphrodisiac?\nIn the case of oysters, probably the classic among the alleged aphrodisiacs, chemical analysis shows that it consists of water, protein and carbohydrates, plus small amounts of fat, sugar and minerals. None of these components is in any way known to affect sex drive or performance. The psychological impact of believing that oysters, raw bull's testicles (""prairie oysters"", as they are called), clams, celery, or tomatoes are aphrodisiacs is sometimes strong enough to produce, at least temporarily, greater sexual desire or performance. The experience of enhanced arousal or performance is then falsely attributed to the wonder food, and this discovery is passed on to the next person wishing to experience new heights of sexual experience.\n\nEating certain foods to increase sexual power, while ineffective, is generally harmless. Other supposed aphrodisiacs, however, are not so innocuous. Spanish fly (cantharides) is one such substance. It is made from a beetle found in southern Europe. The insects are dried and heated until they disintegrate into a fine powder.\n\nWhen taken internally, the substance causes irritation of the bladder and urethra, accompanied by a swelling of associated blood vessels, all of which produce a certain stimulation of the genitals that is interpreted by some men as a sign of lust. The drug can cause an erection, but usually without an increase in sexual desire. Furthermore, if taken in excessive amounts, it can cause violent illness and even death.""",science_mathematics

"Just for  CLEVER!!!!!!! Can U??? Why is the probability of finding a particle at specific position at a certain time proportional to psi SQR?? In the begining it was considered that the wave-function psi is merely an auxiliary mathematical quantity employed to facilitate computations relative to experimental results. This is true to certain extent in certain cases, e.g., in calculating intensity of the waves scattered by a crystal in the direction of the detector; but it does not seem reasonable to introduce an isolated mathematical function without enquiring into its physical significance. \n\nSchrodinger himself attempted the physical interpretation of psi in terms of charge-density. In the experiment of diffraction of electrons (like X-rays diffraction), one might use the optical analogy to arrive at the physical significance of psi. In any electromagnetic system if A is the amplitude of the wave, then the energy density, i.e., energy per unit volume is equal to A^2, so that the number of photons per unit volume, i.e., photon density is equal to (A^2)/[h(nu)], where h(nu) is the energy of a photon. This means that the photon density is proportional to A^2 as h(nu) is constant. \n\nBy analogy, if psi is the amplitude of the matter wave at any point in space, then the number of material particles per unit volume, i.e., the particle density must be proportional to (psi)^2. Thus, the SQUARE OF ABSOLUTE VALUE OF psi IS A MEASURE OF THE PARTICLE DENSITY.",science_mathematics

"What is the perfect wind speed as in MPH to fly a kite? Please don't give kilometers as i don't know how to convert. What would be the right range of wind speed as in not to much or too little. Lizz –\nMost kites are designed for a specific range of wind velocities.  If your kite doesn’t list a range, then it usual default is 5 to 15 mph, especially for diamond shaped (the kind with a tail) or delta wing types.  Box kites need more wind.\nOnly the lightest kites and best flyers can usually get a kite up in a 2 mph wind.  I have flown kites in ranges from 2 to perhaps 35 mph.\nFor 5 mph (steady, with gusts up to 10 mph) most novices can get one up and keep it flying.\n7 mph is usually very easy, 10 isn’t bad.\nSimple kites have a single location to fix the kite string to the kite.  Better kites have ways of adjusting the “bridle” which changes the “tilt” of the kite toward the wind.  This allows them to be flown in a wider range of wind speeds.\nAll of the speeds mentioned above are “ground speeds,” that is the velocity of the wind at ground level.  Keep in mind that the weather report wind speeds are usually not recorded at ground level, so take them as a rough guide.  Also be aware that depending upon where you fly the kite, the difference in velocity only 100 feet up can make a real difference.  Some kites might be hard to get off the ground, but then soar like crazy once they get up.  You will need to experiment.",science_mathematics
"Interview question? Hi I got this question in an interview, and I'm just dying to know how to do it, because I only had 10 mins to complete it!! My best answer is 533, but the most is 567. Please show me how.\n\nProblem:\nA man has a camel with a carrying capacity of 1000. He has to cross 1000km of desert to get to the market to sell his bananas. For each km the camel travels, it requires 1 banana. What is the most he can sell?\n\nMy working:\nHe carries 1000 bananas for 200km and deposits 600. He goes back and does the same. He goes back again and does the same again, but now he has no bananas left at the start, and 2000 at 200km. Next he carries 1000 for 333km and deposits 333 at 533 km. Does this again until 0 at 200km and 1000 at 533km. Then he carries 1000 bananas for 467km to market, which leaves 533 bananas to sell.\n\nPlease try to improve on this and get 567 if you can.\nThanks in advance.

"When will the world end on December 21, 2012?  I don't know what time the world is supposed to end on Dec. 21, 2012, according to the Mayan calendar.  However, there appears to be some controversy about this signaling the end of the world:\n\n""The end of the 13th baktun is conjectured to have been of great significance to the Maya, but does not mark the end of the world. According to the Popol Vuh, a sacred book of the Maya, we are living in the fourth world. The Popol Vuh describes the first three creations that the gods failed in making and the creation of the successful fourth world where men were placed. The Maya believed that the fourth world would end in catastrophe and the fifth and final world would be created that would signal the end of mankind.""\n\nThe last creation ended on a long count of 13.0.0.0.0. Another 13.0.0.0.0 will occur on December 21, 2012, and it has been discussed in many New Age articles and books that this will be the end of this creation or something else entirely. However, the Maya abbreviated their long counts to just the last five vigesimal places. There were an infinitely larger number of units that were usually not shown. When the larger units were shown (notably on a monument from Coba), the end of the last creation is expressed as 13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.0.0.0.0, where the units are obviously supposed to be 13s in all larger places. In this age we are only approaching 0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.13.0.0.0.0, and the larger places are nowhere near the 13s that would match the end of the last creation. (Schele and Friedel 1990: 430)\n\nThis is confirmed by a date from Palenque, which projects forward in time to 1.0.0.0.0.0, which will occur on 13 October, 4772. The Classic Period Maya obviously did not believe that the end of this age would occur in 2012. According to the Maya, there will be a baktun ending in 2012, a significant event being the end of a 13th 400 year period, but not the end of the world.",science_mathematics
"how many miles long and wide is atlantic ocean?  The Atlantic Ocean is the second largest of the world's five oceans (after the Pacific Ocean, but larger than the Indian Ocean, Southern Ocean, and Arctic Ocean).\n\nTotal Area: total: 76.762 million sq km\n\nIt is slightly less than 6.5 times the size of the US\n\nlowest point: Milwaukee Deep in the Puerto Rico Trench -8,605 m \nhighest point: sea level 0 m\n\nExtent and Seas\n\nThe Atlantic Ocean extends in an S shape from the arctic to the antarctic regions between North and South America on the west and Europe and Africa on the east. It is connected with the Arctic Ocean by the Greenland Sea and Smith Sound; with the Pacific Ocean by Drake Passage, the Straits of Magellan, and the Panama Canal; and with the Indian Ocean by the Suez Canal and the expanse between Africa and Antarctica. The shortest distance across the Atlantic Ocean (c.1,600 mi/2,575 km) is between SW Senegal, W Africa, and NE Brazil, E South America. The principal arms of the Atlantic Ocean are Hudson and Baffin bays, the Gulf of Mexico, and the Caribbean Sea in the west; the Baltic, North, Mediterranean, and Black seas in the east; and the Weddell Sea in the south. More large rivers, including the Mississippi, the Congo, and the Amazon, drain into the Atlantic than into any other ocean.\n\nOcean Floor\n\nThe floor of the Atlantic has an average depth of c.12,000 ft (3,660 m). It is separated from that of the Arctic Ocean by a submarine ridge extending from SE Greenland to N Scotland; part of the floor (c.3,000 ft/910 m deep) is known as “telegraph plateau” because of the network of cables laid there. A shallow submarine ridge across the Strait of Gibraltar separates the Mediterranean basin from the Atlantic and limits the exchange of water between the two bodies. The Mid-Atlantic Ridge (c.300–600 mi/480–970 km wide), a submarine mountain range extending c.10,000 mi (16,100 km) from Iceland to near the Antarctic Circle, generally follows the trend of the coastlines of the continents. It rises to an average height of c.10,000 ft (3,050 m), and a few peaks emerge as islands. The ridge, which is the center of volcanic activity and earthquakes, has a great rift that is constantly widening (see seafloor spreading) and filling with molten rock from the earth's interior. As a result the Western Hemisphere and Europe and Africa are moving away from each other. The Mid-Atlantic Ridge divides the floor of the Atlantic Ocean into eastern and western sections that are composed of a series of deep-sea basins (abyssal plains). The greatest depth (c.28,000 ft/8,530 m) is the Milwaukee Deep, in the Puerto Rico Trench, N of Puerto Rico. Scientific knowledge of the ocean floor dates from the Challenger expedition (1872–76).",science_mathematics

"How come insects grew to massive sizes in the past  but not now? I understand that one of the main limiting factors on the size of invertabrates with exoskeletons is that 1) as they get larger they find it difficult to obtain enough material grow new skeletons when growing, 2) when sheding the animal has no suppport untill the new skeleton has hardened, 3) Gas transport in large organisms cannot just rely on diffusion. If this is true how come insects in the ancient past could grow to such large sizes Nobody really knows. One explanation is that oxygen levels in the atmosphere were higher in the past for reasons we don't understand. That is supported to some degree by isotope ratios in rocks. With higher oxygen levels insects could grow larger without running into problems of gas diffusion.\n\nThe other hypothesis is that the greenhouse world that existed when the giant insects did was incredibly productive and allowed for extravagant solutions that would  not be energetically feasible today. For example insects today can achieve limited active respiration by pumping their abdomens  but it is amazingly wasteful of energy. However in world with limitless food that may not have been limiting. That theory is supported to some degree by the fact that the giant insect fossils only turn up in the equivalent of rainforest locales, IOW in the most productive areas of the planet.\n\nIt is worth noting that the giant insects seem to have come and gone at least twice. They were common in the Carboniferous and then died out and re-emerged around the Silurian. That suggests that whatever was limiting them was somehow recurring.",science_mathematics

"how often do Mexican Red-Kneed Tarantula give birth?  The mating season, lasting from September to October, is followed by a nine-month gestation period after which 600- 700 eggs are laid and wrapped in a silky cocoon which the female, alone, guards aggressively. The mother tolerates the babies for a short period of time in which she might even feed them regurgitated food, but very briefly. Within a matter of weeks, or certainly by the time the female has her next molt, the babies are on their own. The mortality rate is very high and ants are a major menace. The life span of the female is thought to be 15- 25 years and possibly more than that. The male lives a much shorter time, not only because the female sometimes eats him, but more frequently because he does not molt correctly, or cannot escape his molt for some reason. Also, the male is usually the one seeking to mate, and so is more exposed to predictors.",science_mathematics
"is there a formula for figuring terminal velocity of objects e.g. sphere of plastic vs. sphere of lead?  A correction to the first answer. The formula terminal V = SQRT(2W/(Cd*R*A)) is correct, as it expresses the fact that W is balanced by the drag force V^2*Cd*R*A/2. However, for two same-sized smooth balls of different materials, only W changes; Cd stays the same. The air density R depends only on altitude.\nSince air density increases with decreasing altitude, the terminal speed decreases during a fall. If dropped from high enough, the actual fall speed, which initially = 0, increases until the (decreasing) terminal speed is reached, and then the sign of the net force (gravitational + drag) changes so the falling ball slows. For the remainder of the fall, the terminal and fall speeds both decrease, but the fall speed is slightly faster. This speed difference provides the net upward force to slow the ball.",science_mathematics

"how does atmospheric pressure change with altitude?  There are basically two things happening in regards to atmospheric pressure, both caused by the same thing.\n\n1.Pull from below-Gravity is pulling on all of the molecules so the heavier a molecule is, the closer to the surface of the earth it wants to be as a result of gravity.\n\n2. Push from above-Because gravity is pulling on all of the atmosphere's molecules, all of them ""want"" to be at the earth's surface. If you were to remove all of the most dense air at the surface, all of the less dense molecules above would simply be pulled down to take the place of the removed ones. This results in the molecules above pushing down on those below, adding to the force that gravity is exerting on them. (more pressure)\n\n\nThe atmosphere is basically arranged most dense (closest to the earth's surface) to least dense (outermost region of the atmosphere) according to the atomic weight of the molecules.\n\nSo the further you go upward into the atmosphere, the less molecules there are that ""want"" to be at the earth's surface, and therefore the less atmospheric pressure there is.\n\nHope this helps",science_mathematics

"What is reversible phosphorylation?  Reversible phosphorylation has long been an attractive mechanism to control cycles of coat assembly and disassembly during clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Many of the coat proteins are phosphorylated in vivo and in vitro. Our work has focused on the role of phosphorylation of the mu2 subunit of AP-2 (adaptor protein 2), which appears to be necessary for efficient cargo recruitment. Studies to probe the regulation of mu2 phosphorylation demonstrated that clathrin is a specific activator of the mu2 kinase, and, in permeabilized cells, cargo sequestration, driven by exogenously added clathrin, results in elevated levels of m2 phosphorylation. Furthermore, phosphorylated mu2 is mainly associated with assembled clathrin in vivo and its steady-state level is strongly reduced in cells depleted of clathrin heavy chain. Our results imply a central role for clathrin in the regulation of cargo selection via modulation of phospho-mu2 levels.

"Introduction to Physics. I need help with some homework questions.? Please do not answer ""I don't know.""  I do report those who try to get points when they don't know an answer. Question #1. When a 4kg object is suspended by a scale in water, the scale reads 3.2kg.  What is the density of the object?  Question #2. Two charged particles are separated by 5m.  The attractive force between them is 54N.  Find the force between them when they are separated by 15cm.\nPlease tell me as much as you can (i.e. formulas)to find the answers. 1. the object is pushed up by the weight of its equivalent volume of water, 4-3.2=0.8l\nSo the object's density is equal to its mass divided by its volume:\n4kg/0.8l=4kg/0.0008m3=40,000kg/8m3=5000kg/m3\n\n2. the force decreases with the square of distance, so it will be 3^2=9 times smaller, which is 6N.",science_mathematics
"Where can I get hands on medical experience? I'm a junior premed student at an undergraduate level, looking into pursuing a career as a physician's assistant. I have all of the requirements necessary for applying to PA schools, except that I have no hands on experience. Most of these schools prefer actual experience to shadowing. Where should I turn for this much needed expereince? Other than volunteering, there are several types of summer programs where you can shadow physicians in hospitals or do clinical or lab based research, all of which bolster your application.  \nLook into programs by the Robert Woods Johnson Foundation, if you are a member of a minority group, there are some specific programs available.  Otherwise, many med schools have programs available for local college students for shadowing or research, you just have to call and ask.  \n\nLastly, if you know a local PA or physician, just ask if it is possible to shadow at their office; many docs and PAs like to teach and, as long as the patients are OK with you being there (most patients don't mind, actually), you can be in the room to observe the interview and examination.

What is true is that throughout recorded history Man has a shown a fascination for the heavens and the arrangement of the stars, the literal meaning of ""astronomy"" in Greek. Today, astronomy normally refers to the systematic observations of heavenly bodies, while astrophysics refers to the branch of science that attempts to understand these observations using more fundamental concepts in mathematics and physics. Some people make this distinction; others use ""astronomy"" and ""astrophysics"" interchangeably. \nIt is often felt that astronomy as a scientific discipline emerged from the Babylonian culture. It was the Babylonians who first developed the mathematics necessary to make accurate predictions from the observed patterns on the sky. There is no doubt, however, that many other cultures may have used astronomical observations for time keeping purposes and perhaps even to ascertain directions for navigation.""",science_mathematics

PART 1:\nIf the ratio of the diameters is 1 : 2 : 3, then that means the diameters are 18 : 36 : 54.  You can solve this with similar ratios:\n\n1/18 = 2/x\nx = 36\n\n1/18 = 3/y\ny = 54\n\nSo the respective diameters are 18"", 36"" and 54"".  (The radii would be half this or 9"", 18"", 27"").\n\nHowever, the answer is to be expressed in feet so divide by 12:\n54 inches / 12 inches/ft = 4.5 feet.\n\nPART 2:\nVolume of the *middle* sphere.  The radius is 18"" (one half of 36""), so just plug this into the formula:\nV = (4/3)(pi)(18)^3\nV = 7,776 pi (cubic inches)\n\nPART 3:\nThe volume of the *small* sphere = (4/3)(pi)(9)^3\nThe volume of the *middle* sphere = (4/3)(pi)(18)^3\n\nTo get the ratio between these two, just divide smallest / biggest\n= (4/3)(pi)(9^3) / (4/3)(pi)(18^3)\nThe 4/3 and pi cancel out\n= 9^3 / 18^3\n= 729 / 5,832\n= 1 : 8\n\nThis makes sense because the ratio of lengths is linear (1 : 2 : 3), the ratio of areas is squared (1 : 4 : 9) and the ratio of volumes is cubic (1 : 8 : 27).\n\nPART 4:\nWe have the 3 diameters (18"", 36"", 54"").  the total height is the sum:\n18 + 36 + 54 = 108""\n\nConvert this to feet (divide by 12):\n108 inches / 12 inches/ft = 9 feet.",science_mathematics

"Is sickle-cell anemia only encountered in people of African descent? Just curious. Sickle-cell anemia is encountered almost exclusively in people of African descent, although there are always exceptions.  The reason sickle-cell anemia is so common (compared to other genetic disorders) in certain populations is that carriers of the gene (i.e. people who have only one copy of it) have slightly oddly shaped red blood cells, which don't cause any problems for them but aren't so great for the parasite that causes malaria.  Since carriers are resistant to malaria, the gene that causes sickle-cell is extremely common only within populations from regions where malaria is endemic.  Since malaria is quite prevalent in many regions of Africa, sickle-cell is also prevalent in people whose ancestry traces back to those regions.  Sickle-cell can pop up anywhere, in any population through random mutation (if I remember correctly, it's a single nucleotide mutation), but without malaria to give heterozygous individuals (i.e. carriers) an advantage, it does not become nearly as common as it did in African populations.",science_mathematics

"How much energy does Earth receive from the sun each day? Might be a hard question.  I know there are various sources of energy but I figured that would be too hard of a question, and I wouldn't believe any answers to that question anyway, so I figure I'll say energy just from the sun.  Also if there are any rough estimates on how much of that energy then escapes that would be cool too.  My aim is to compare the total energy possible to receive to global energy consumption, just to get a better idea reality. The enormous amount of energy continuously emitted by the sun is dispersed into outer space in all directions. Only a small fraction of this energy is intercepted by the earth and other solar planets. \nThe solar energy reaching the periphery of the earth's atmosphere is considered to be constant for all practical purposes, and is known as the solar constant. Because of the difficulty in achieving accurate measurements, the exact value of the solar constant is not known with certainty but is believed to be between 1,353 and 1,395 W/m2 (approximately 1.4 kW/m2, or 2.0 cal/cm2/min). The solar constant value is estimated on the basis of the solar radiation received on a unit area exposed perpendicularly to the rays of the sun at an average distance between the sun and the earth. \n\nIn passing through outer space, which is characterized by vacuum, the different types of solar energy remain intact and are not modified until the radiation reaches the top of the earth's atmosphere. In outer space, therefore, one would expect to encounter the types of radiation listed in Table 1, which are: gamma ray, X-ray, ultraviolet, and infrared radiations.",science_mathematics

"what are the different variables in speeding the sublimation of dry ice in liquids?and does density have effct My science group did an experiment about the time dry ice sublimated in different liquids. We had coke, cookink oil and alcohol. We thought that the more dense the liquid was the slower it sublimated, but we were wrong. I just want to know the variables that make the dry ice sublimate faster if there are any. \nThank you very much The main variables, as I recall it from ages ago when I was studying such things, would be the ambient temperature and pressure, and the amount of surface area per unit volume of dry ice you've got.

"Can Pluto regain its status as a planet? We know that Pluto was reclassified as a ""dwarf planet"" by the IAU because it has not cleared its own orbit of debris.\nhttp://www.iau2006.org/mirror/www.iau.or...\n\nIt meets the other two criteria for a planet. So, as time passes and Pluto accretes more of the small objects in its path, will it clear the orbit enough to regain its status as a planet. None of us will be alive at that time, of course. I suppose that what I am really asking is, ""How clear is clear?""\n\nThanks! This issue is very similar to the asteroid belt issue some 150 years ago.  When the first asteroid, Ceres, was found, it was considered a planet.  Only after 15 other ""planets"" were found in the same orbit regime did astronomers downgrade these asteroids to ""minor planets"" some 50 years after Ceres' discovery.\n\nIt's unclear if Pluto could ever clear its orbit...it crrently has only 7% of the mass of its orbital neighborhood (as opposed to, say, Earth, which contains some 99.9999% the mass of its orbital neighborhood), so it's only cleared a tiny fraction of its orbit throughout the entire age of the Solar System, 4.5 billion years.\n\nMoreover, other objects in Pluto's orbit (and pluto itself, in fact) are trapped in a 3:2 orbital resonance with Neptune.  This means these ""plutinos"" are in a very stable orbit, unlikely to be scattered away unless something very big and unexpected comes along.",science_mathematics

"What is gravity Power.? I was told Power  equals force times velocity. The Gravity Economy\n\nGravity as a power source is fascinating. It is more abundant than hydrogen, more far reaching than solar power. It exists in dark places with still winds and in climates cold and warm. We've been tapping its power for thousands of years -- through water wheels, dams, and clockwork counter weights.\n\nGeothermal power is a form of gravity power at work. The pressure of the outer earth on its core keeps things hot, rocks and metals, molten. Temperatures can reach 9,000 degrees, almost as hot as the Sun. The original heat may date back to the formation of the earth, which was also the result of gravitational forces. Geothermal power is being used cleanly and successfully in areas where the heat of the earth is relatively easy to tap.\n\nHowever, most of gravity's power comes from devices that use the flow of water. Precipitation conveniently drops water for us in high places in the form of snow and rain, then gravity does the work of transporting it downhill to the sea. Dams and waterwheels are the best known examples. These systems work great and produce no emissions. In fact, by acting on the water of the Columbia River, gravity is powering my computer right now.",science_mathematics

"Electrical Engineering? What is the max. allowable phase difference between two sources before synchronizing (parallel operation)? If a quick transfer device is used for changeover, is there a condition for max. phase difference? As already mentioned, the maximum phase angle difference is dependent on the device; however, it is ALSO dependent on the ""stiffness"" of both the system and the generator being switched on.\n\nA large, stable electrical grid can tolerate a generator coming online with a larger phase difference, because the system will ""pull"" the generator into line with itself. If the generator is significantly large compared to the system, though ... both will go offline.\n\nIt is not uncommon to require that a generator be within a limit of phase difference around +/- 0.5 degrees (electrical) before switching into the grid.

"What is the history and origin of planetary geology?  If you’re asking about the research discipline of “planetary geology,” then its origins are rather recent.  Speculation existed about the nature of other planets’ surfaces—e.g., Lowell’s canals on Mars or the oft-envisioned swamps of Venus—but until we started sending spacecraft to explore the worlds and bring back data, such speculations didn’t amount to much of a science.\n\nMost would consider Eugene Shoemaker (1928–1997) the founder of planetary geology; he started the Astrogeology Research Program of the United States Geological Survey in 1961.  Shoemaker’s focus was on asteroids and meteorites, but with increasing quantities of data returned to Earth by missions to Mars, Venus, and other locales, the science grew to encompass many different worlds.\n\nPlanetary geologists study the origin, evolution, and structure of planets and their moons, as well as comets and asteroids.  (The more general term “planetary science” includes disciplines that include orbital dynamics, planetary atmospheres, and so forth.)  Of course, Earth provides a spectacular example of geological processes at work, but many of them (plate tectonics, for example) are unique to our home world.  Nonetheless, interesting analogies exist to the kind of events that may have taken place on other planets, moons, and such, so the challenge is to know what to learn from the well-known terrestrial science of geology and when to keep an open mind.\n\n(At least that’s my best shot.  My background is in astronomy, though, so details of this description might be a little off.)\n\nFor some interesting popular-level articles on the topic of planetary geology, take a look at links on the Geology News website:\nhttp://geology.rockbandit.net/category/planetary-geology/\n\n\nRyan Wyatt\nRose Center for Earth & Space\nNew York, New York",science_mathematics

But as the airplane looses height, the waves can be distinguished and we see that the see surface in reality is three-dimensional.\n\nThe same might be true for the universe: it could be that more dimensions are present, but we don't see them as they are tiny, too small to observe from our human scale.\n\nTheories that suppose the existences of more dimensions have been proposed.\n \nThey were invented because we are not so happy about the models we use now.

Three of them -electromagnetism, the strong nuclear force and the weak nuclear force- have been combined into one force that has three manifestations at our energy scale.\n \nTo model the fourth force -gravity- Einstein invented general relativity.\n\nThe problem is that both theories are incompatible.

"What are the effects on the human body from deep sea diving? I want to know if the deeper you dive, does the water get heavier? There are many effects that pressure has on human physiology from nitrogen narcosis, inert gas saturation of tissues, and even disbaricosteonecrosis. You could write a book and still not fully explain the effects of pressure on a human and indeed many have been written. But your question regarding water is a very simple one. Water is incompressible. Therefore no mater how great the pressure is the density and thus the weight do not change. There is one effect that might make it seem like the water is heavier though. Water has a predictable yet subtle thermal expansion patteren. Typically the deeper one goes, the colder the ocean is. Water is densest around 35 degrees Fahrenheit.

"how to caluate motor belt speed?  INTRODUCTION TO MOTOR, PULLEY AND BELT\nA motor is a prime mover means it provides power to mechanical system or machines. A motor converts electrical energy into mechanical energy which is transmitted by belt drive to perform some mechanical work. The armature (extension of the rotating part) of a motor is coupled with a shaft by a coupling (coupling is a device which connects two shafts so that if one is rotating, the other also rotates). From this shaft power is transmitted to a distant shaft by belt drive. Separate pulleys are present and keyed (means fixed with shaft so that both shaft and pulley rotate as a whole) to each of the driver and driven shaft and joined by a belt in such a way that if one pulley rotates the other also rotates.\n\nDRIVER AND DRIVEN PULLEY SPEEDS\nLet the driver pulley rotate at 'N1' rpm (revolution per minute) and the driven pulley rotate at 'N2' rpm. If the diameters of the respective pulleys be 'D1' metre and 'D2' metre respectively then we have the relation N1/N2 = D2/D1.\n\nBELT SPEED CALCULATION\nNow, we are in a position to start the belt speed calculation. The surface speed of the driver pulley is given by V1 = pi*D1*N1 metre/minute = pi*D1*N1/60 metre/second. In ideal condition i.e. if no slippage was present then the belt speed would have been equal to the surface speed of the driver pulley i.e. equal to 'V1'. But actually there is aways some slippage between the belt and pulley surface so the speed of the belt is always less than 'V1'. If this slip factor is 's' then the belt speed is (1-s)*V1 \n= pi*D1*N1*(1-s)/60 metre/second.",science_mathematics

"teh structure of DNA is often compared to a ""ziper."" Why?  DNA replication is semi-conservative, ie. one half of the parent duplex is transmitted to each of the daughter cells during cell division.  Replication begins at the site of origin called ""Oric"" site. Two enzymes  DNA gyrases and DNA helicasesbind to the origin points and induce the unwinding of complementary strands of DNA double helix.  Another protein called ""single stranded binding protein"" bind to single stranded region and keep them in  single stranded condition.  An enzyme called ""primase"" initiates transcription of the strand at 5'-3' direction.  So the 3' -OH end of this primer RNA  ( which initiated DNA synthesis)  provides the initiation point for DNA polymerase for the sequential addition of deoxyribonucleotides. DNA Polymerase enzyme progressively adds deoxyribonucleotides to the free 3-OH ends of this growing polynucleotide chain so that the replication of the 3' - 5'  strand is continuous ie. the growth of the new strand is in 5'-3' direction. The DNA polymerase is the prime replicase responsible for replication , editing or proof reading and for the removal of RNA primers after the DNA strand synthesis.  Then DNA ligase seals the fragments of the lagging strand into a continuous polynucleotide. So because of this mechanism of unwinding and closing themselves like a ZIP it is compared to a ZIPPER.",science_mathematics

"Thermo question...? I got through just about all of the problems with the exception of this last one.\n\nA water parcel of mass m and initial temperature 15 C falls over a waterfall that is 100m high. Calculate the change in temperature, change in specific entropy, and amount of energy per unit mass degraded during the fall.\n\nI can calculate the change in entropy using the standard s = -dQ/dT relationship once I find the change in temperature. Where I'm actually stuck is figuring out how to calculate the change in temp. and the amount of energy degraded. Would I use the first law?\n\nI asked this in the Physics category and someone said to use U = mgh and then to factor in the specific heat of water, but I'm not sure how I'm supposed to use that.  Am I letting Q = mgh???  Then the masses would cancel and you'd get 980 = (4186)(T2-T1).\n\nBut Q is heating and U is gravitational energy.  So I'm confused. This seems to be a question about conversion of one type of energy into another.  In this case, gravitational potential energy (Ep) is converted to kinetic energy (Ek), and then to thermal energy (Q).\n\nThe loss of gravitational potential energy when it falls\ndelta Ep = mg(delta h) \nwhere m is the mass of the object, g is the gravitational force constant 9.81 N/kg, and delta h is the change in height,  is equal to its increase in kinetic energy. \n\nI don't really believe that the kinetic energy is entirely converted to thermal energy, but if you assume that it is,\nQ = m (deltaT)c  \nwhere m is the mass of the water being heated, delta T is the change in temperature, and c is the specific heat capacity of water (4.184 J/goC)\n\nSo,    if              delta Ep = Q\n\nthen                      mg(deltah)  = m (deltaT) c  \n   \nand                    (deltaT)  =  g (delta h)/c\n\n\nGood luck !",science_mathematics

"Why do bears hibernate?  When fall turns to winter and the temperature dips, the food sources for the wild animals becomes very scarce.  Some animals wait out the harsh conditions of winter, constantly searching for food and shelter.  Other animals, like the bear, spend the winter in hibernation. \n     Hibernation is a dormant sleep-like state.  By going into hibernation the bears bypass winter when their food supply, nuts and berries, disappears.  Animals like the bear would find it extremely difficult to find enough food during winter, and therefore go into hibernation. \n\n     During hibernation the bear cuddles up in a cave or in a hollowed out tree, safe from the dangers of winter.  In order to survive this long period of inactivity the bear must build up its body weight by accumulating fat.  In the months before  hibernation bears can gain up to forty pounds of fat per week.   A bear’s body goes through several changes once it enters hibernation.  Its heartbeat drops from fifty-five beats per minute to ten beats per minute, and the bear’s body temperature will drop from five to nine degrees below normal.  While in hibernation the bear uses  the stored energy it accumulated as fat to survive.  So a bear can lose from fifteen to forty percent of its body weight during the winter just by sleeping! \n\n     Bears will generally enter hibernation in early October and emerge sometime in April or May, when their food is plentiful again.  The hibernation cycle is just another unique adaptation of nature that allows many animals like the bear to survive during the severe conditions of winter time. \n\nhope this helps.",science_mathematics
"How much of Pompeii and Herculaneum has been uncovered since the eruption of Mount Vesuvius?  Per Wikipedia.org:\n\n""Most of the archeological digs at the site only extend down to the street level of the 79 volcanic event. Deeper digs in older part of Pompeii and core samples of nearby drillings have exposed layers of jumbled sediment that suggest that other events hit the city before the famed volcano, as three sheets of sediment have been found on top of the lava bedrock that lies below the city. Mixed in with the sediment, archeologists have found bits of animal bone, pottery shards and bits of plants. Using carbon dating, the oldest layer has been placed as 8th century BC, about the time that the city was founded. The other two layers are separated from the other layers by well developed soil layers or Roman pavement and were laid down in the 4th century BC and 2nd century BC. The theory behind the layers of jumbled sediment is large landslides, perhaps triggered by extended rainfall. (Senatore, et al., 2004)\n\nDuring early excavations of the site, occasional voids in the ash layer were found that contained human remains. Giuseppe Fiorelli had the idea of filling the empty spaces with plaster. What resulted were highly accurate and eerie forms of the doomed Pompeiani who failed to escape, in their last moment of life (see [1], [2], [3]). For some of them the expression of terror is quite clearly visible.\nVictims of the eruption\nEnlarge\nVictims of the eruption\n\nGeologists have used the magnetic characteristics of rocks and debris found in Pompeii to estimate the temperature of the pyroclastic flow that buried the city. When molten rock solidifies, magnetic minerals in the rock record the direction of Earth's magnetic field. If the material is heated above a certain temperature, known as the Curie temperature, the magnetic field may be modified or completely reset.\n\nAnalysis of over 200 volcanic rocks and pieces of debris, such as roof tiles, suggest that the ash cloud had a temperature of 850°C when emerging from the mouth of Vesuvius. It had cooled to below 350°C by the time it reached the city. Most of the materials analyzed experienced temperatures between 240°C and 340°C. A few areas showed lower temperatures of only 180°C. It is theorized that turbulence may have mixed cool air into the ash cloud. (Cioni, et al., 2004)""",science_mathematics

"What food sources can you contact botulism from?  Foodborne botulism has often been from home-canned foods with low acid content, such as asparagus, green beans, beets, and corn. However, outbreaks of botulism have resulted from more unusual sources. In July, 2002, fourteen Alaskans ate muktuk (whale meat) from a beached whale, and eight of them developed symptoms of botulism, two of them requiring mechanical ventilation. Other origins of infection include chopped garlic in oil, chile peppers, tomatoes, improperly handled baked potatoes wrapped in aluminum foil, and home-canned or fermented fish. Persons who do home canning should follow strict hygienic procedures to reduce contamination of foods. Oils infused with garlic or herbs should be refrigerated. Potatoes which have been baked while wrapped in aluminum foil should be kept hot until served or refrigerated. Because the botulism toxin is destroyed by high temperatures, persons who eat home-canned foods should consider boiling the food for 10 minutes before eating it to ensure safety. Canned foods may also indicate botulism infestation by characteristic outward bulges which result from the bacteria causing pressure to rise inside the can due to gas produced as a waste product, it would be safest to simply throw such cans away. Because honey, and other sweeteners, can form an ideal medium for botulism growth, infants should not be fed them until they are weaned and their digestive juices become too acidic for the bacteria to grow.",science_mathematics

"what's the difference between diesal and gas engines?  well magician325. to begin with there are no spark plugs in a diesel engine. the diesel is ignited by compression alone. a diesel does however have glow plugs which are used only during the starting of the engine. they vaporize the diesel fuel so the combustion reaction can happen easier. the diesel fuel is a lot heavier hydrocarbon and is thus less volitile than the gasoline. compression is very important to the starting of a diesel engine. the extra compression requirements best noticed in the presence of the two(or more) batteries on most diesels.  these provide the extra cranking amps required to work against that extra compression. ok on to the fuel. the fuel in a diesel is injected into the cylinders by the diesel pump( imagine that hu) and the air is simpily sucked in by the piston action unless a turbo is used. ok the gas burners well they have carberators on them and some have fuel injection. so with carbs the fuel is mixed in with the air as the air enters the motor. a fuel injected engine is similar in that it has individual injectors, but the gas burners have a fuel pump which pressurizes fuel rails. in the diesel there are individual lines from the diesel pump to each injector, but the injectors on a gas engine all tie together. ok the combustion in a gas engine is started by the spark plugs. well i hope this is followable. oh yeah with gas engines you can get more rpm's but less torque, however with a diesel you get less rpm's but a lot more torque. later",science_mathematics

"Anyone know what the ""average"" starting pay for a newly minted PharmD (Doctor of Pharmacy) is?  I think you have to think of two different things before you can answer this.\n\nIt depends on the field (retail, hospital, FDA/government, industry, educational, clinical specialist, home infusion, nuclear, etc.).\n\nIt depends also on the demand (higher demand in retirement states--Florida, California, Arizona).\n\nThe majority of new graduates go into retail pharmacy, where, for example, in the Washington DC area, starting salaries are north of $45/hr.  In California, you are talking about six-figure income base salary.  In retail, your salaries start high but they do not go much higher as you get older.  The second most common pharmacist position is probably hospital, where you start off lower but as you get more experienced, your pay will rise much faster than in retail.  Industry, nuclear, government pharmacist jobs are pretty limited to certain locations in the country.  Industry pays pretty comparable, if not better than retail, but it is hard to get in, and you would be hard pressed to get a job as a new graduate (they like experienced people), and you'd probably have to move to Philadelphia or New York or New Jersey.  FDA and government pay is like any other government job--the pay is lower, but you get a certain portion of your salary that in not taxable, and the benefits are really good (9 to 5, all government holidays, government pension after 20 or 25 years, etc.).  They claim that the after-tax money you make is similar to what you would make in a retail setting but that is not really true.\n\nThe final thing I would add though, is that money is not everything.  You have to look at benefits and lifestyle.  You may make more in retail but you are under the constant pressure of customers wanting their prescriptions filled 10 minutes ago and asking why their copayment is now $25 as opposed to $5 last month.",science_mathematics

"Know anything about roads with heating elements in them? I think they have some in Japan. How are they heated? What is the construction and composition of the element? Volts and Watts used?\nAnything you can tell me really. Yes, it is done.  It tends to be expensive to install and to operate so it only in places like:\n\nDriving entrances (in snow country) to high-end hotels or ski areas.  Toll plazas.\n\nDrive-up/drop-off lanes and walkway access to hospitals and medical buildings - lots of old and frial people who could break a hip (and sue).\n\nHousehold walkways and entrance steps - small areas.\n\nAnd, in a McMansion, anything goes.  Heat the whole dang driveway to impress the neighbors.\n\nFor 10 to 50 square feet, usually electric resistance heating wires would be placed in the concrete pour or within the thinset under tiles.  After a snowfall, you turn on a timer for a few hours (ideally you brush the snow off first).  The wires are spaced 3 to 6 inches apart and at a watt density of about 50 watts per square foot, 20-square foot step would take 1 kilowatt.  About 8 amps of 120 volts or 4.5 amps of 208 volts.  The cheapest installation I've done used the heating cables sold for combatting ice dams formation on roofs.\n\nFor driveways, etc, the area is so large you are almost always burning fuel and circulating a water/gycol mix.  Then 1/2"" or 3/4"" PEX (cross-linked polyethylene) tubing is imbedded in the concrete pour on 6 to 12 inch centers (just like in my own slab-on-grade house).   At 100-200 BTU/hour per square foot, a 100 foot driveway, 15 feet wide would take 150,000-300,000 BTU/hour.  That's far bigger than your home hot water heater, so you're buying a whole separate (and large) water heater for this task.  Operating it for a few hours after a snowfall would cost $10 or so.\n\nInsulating below, dealing with meltwater run off, and controls are a few of the design issues.  I installed my own because 1) it is really nice to have a completely ice-free walk, and 2) I could (many years of engineering and several as a plumber).  But for most people, it isn't a DIY project.  You'd at least want an experienced designer advising on the layout.\n\nNote that any power plant has to dump heat.  I have long thought that in snow country, they should imbed pipes in the local roads and then, in winter, no snow or ice would stick.  But snow plows are pretty cheap compared to the capital cost.

As the article below mentions, in the wake of last year's tragedy, dolphins were found as much as 1500 feet inland and sharks were being pulled out of swimming pools.

"how Earth's Magnetic Field Helped to Prove Plate Tectonics?  Magnetic striping on the sea floor was used as an early proof of plate tectonics, as it showed the sea floor was spreading away from a central axis.\n\nThe following is taken from http://volcano.und.nodak.edu/vwdocs/vwlessons/plate_tectonics/part9.html\n\nIn the late 1950's, scientists mapped the present-day magnetic field generated by rocks on the floor of the Pacific Ocean. The volcanic rocks which make up the sea floor have magnetization because, as they cool, magnetic minerals within the rock align to the Earth's magnetic field. The intensity of the magnetic field they measured was very different from the intensity they had calculated. Thus, the scientists detected magnetic anomalies, or differences in the magnetic field from place to place. They found positive and negative magnetic anomalies. Positive magnetic anomalies are places where the magnetic field is stronger than expected. Positive magnetic anomalies are induced when the rock cools and solidifies with the Earth's north magnetic pole in the northern geographic hemisphere. The Earth's magnetic field is enhanced by the magnetic field of the rock. Negative magnetic anomalies are magnetic anomalies that are weaker than expected. Negative magnetic anomalies are induced when the rock cools and solidifies with the Earth's north magnetic pole in the southern geographic hemisphere. The resultant magnetic field is less than expected because the Earth's magnetic field is reduced by the magnetic field of the rock.\n\n     When mapped, the anomalies produce a zebra-striped pattern of parallel positive and negative bands. The pattern was centered along, and symmetrical to, the mid-ocean ridge.\n\n    A hypothesis was presented in 1963 by Fred Vine and Drummond Matthews to explain this pattern. They proposed that lava erupted at different times along the rift at the crest of the mid-ocean ridges preserved different magnetic anomalies.\n\nVine and Matthews proposed that lava erupted on the sea floor on both sides of the rift, solidified, and moved away before more lava was erupted. If the Earth's magnetic field had reversed (changed from one geographic pole to the other) between the two eruptions, the lava flows would preserve a set of parallel bands with different magnetic properties. The ability of Vine and Matthews' hypothesis to explain the observed pattern of ocean floor magnetic anomalies provided strong support for sea floor spreading.",science_mathematics

"why is the sky blue? reflection of the ocean or due to wavelenght of light WHY IS THE SKY BLUE?\n\nThe blue color of the sky is due to Rayleigh scattering. As light moves through the atmosphere, most of the longer wavelengths pass straight through. Little of the red, orange and yellow light is affected by the air.\n\nHowever, much of the shorter wavelength light is absorbed by the gas molecules. The absorbed blue light is then radiated in different directions. It gets scattered all around the sky. Whichever direction you look, some of this scattered blue light reaches you. Since you see the blue light from everywhere overhead, the sky looks blue.\n\nAs you look closer to the horizon, the sky appears much paler in color. To reach you, the scattered blue light must pass through more air. Some of it gets scattered away again in other directions. Less blue light reaches your eyes.

"What are the major strutures and functions of Gamma Proteobacteria?  Hey..are you trying to get your homework done here !! OK seriously speaking.......... The Proteobacteria are a major group of bacteria. They include a wide variety of pathogens, such as Escherichia, Salmonella, Vibrio, Helicobacter, and many other notable genera. Others are free-living, and include many of the bacteria responsible for nitrogen fixation. The group is defined primarily in terms of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) sequences, and is named for the Greek god Proteus (also the name of a bacterial genus within the Proteobacteria), who could change his shape, because of the great diversity of forms found in it.\n\nThe proteobacteria are divided into five sections, referred to by the Greek letters alpha through epsilon, again based on rRNA sequences. These are often treated as classes. Gamma Proteobacteria are paraphyletic to the Beta Proteobacteria.\n\nThe Gammaproteobacteria comprise several medically and scientifically important groups of bacteria, such as the Enterobacteriaceae, Vibrionaceae and Pseudomonadaceae. An exceeding number of important pathogens belongs to this class, e.g. Salmonella (enteritis and typhoid fever), Yersinia (plague), Vibrio (cholera), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (lung infections in hospitalised or cystic fibrosis patients).\n\n\nHope this help :)",science_mathematics

"what is maths?  Mathematics, study of relationships among quantities, magnitudes, and properties and of logical operations by which unknown quantities, magnitudes, and properties may be deduced. In the past mathematics was regarded as the science of quantity, whether of magnitudes, as in geometry, or of numbers, as in arithmetic, or the generalization of these two fields, as in algebra. Towards the middle of the 19th century mathematics came to be regarded increasingly as the science of relations, or as the science that draws necessary conclusions. This latter view encompasses mathematical or symbolic logic— the science of using symbols to provide an exact theory of logical deduction and inference based on definitions, axioms, postulates, and rules for transforming primitive elements into more complex relations and theorems.\n\nThis brief survey of the history of mathematics traces the evolution of mathematical ideas and concepts, beginning in prehistory. Indeed, mathematics is nearly as old as humanity itself: evidence of a sense of geometry and interest in geometric pattern has been found in the designs of prehistoric pottery and textiles and in cave paintings. Primitive counting systems were almost certainly based on using the fingers of one or both hands, as evidenced by the predominance of the numbers 5 and 10 as the bases for most number systems today.",science_mathematics

"What are the effects of mass and air resistance on Gravitational Acceleration? Just Help me in discussing the effects of mass and air resistance to ""Gravitational Acceleration"". Thanks If, by ""gravitational acceleration,"" you mean the acceleration of gravity, g, then the answer is that air resistance has no effect.  But you probably mean the acceleration of an object due to gravity.  If you drop an object, it accelerates downward, initially with an acceleration of g, ie, 9.81 m/s^2 or 32.2 ft/s^2.  But as soon as it is moving, the air striking its surface exerts a force on it that opposes its fall.  That force increases with the square of the object's velocity; in other words, if the velocity is, say, 10 m/s, the force on it due to air resistance will be 4 times what it was at 5 m/s.  The object will continue to accelerate, but its acceleration will continually decrease.  Finally, when the force on it due to air resistance is equal to the force of the gravitational attraction, it will reach a constant velocity.  That's what's called ""terminal velocity.""  If there is no air resistance, mass has no effect on the object's acceleration.  However, a more massive object will reach a higher terminal velocity than a less massive one, if both experience the same air resistance.  In other words, a sphere made of lead will accelerate faster and reach a higher velocity than one made of aluminum, if they're the same diameter and have the same surface properties.",science_mathematics

"besides the 5 basic senses, sight ,smell,touch,taste, hearing, what other senses do we have?  In the 1920s, at a time when conventional physiology only recognized five or six senses, Rudolf Steiner proposed that there were far more. He defined twelve senses; of these twelve, the first nine are now well-recognized: the equilibrioceptive (balance), proprioceptive (movement), nociceptive (sense of pain and wellness), tactile (touch), gustatory (taste), olfactory (smell), thermoceptive (warmth), visual and auditory senses. Steiner proposed three more senses as well: the sense of phoneme or language, the sense of thought and the sense of ego (the ability to recognize an ego outside of our own); he termed these three 'higher senses' that depended upon the healthy development of the foundational senses of balance, movement, pain/wellness and touch.

Hot air rises.  AS it rises it expands due to lowered atmospheric pressure.  As it expands it cools and begins to decend again.  Also if the air is moist as it cools it must release the moisture (rain -or hail if it is high and cold enough.)  This begins a circulation pattern up in the middle and down outside.  Often hail will begin to fall only to be caught in an updraft and carried aloft again.  This cycle continues until the hail is too heavy for the updrafts to lift it and it makes it to the ground.  This is why very strong thunderstoms with violent updrafts produce large hail.",science_mathematics

When it gets dark at night, the light comes on, but the light from the bulb is reflected back to the photocell. The photocell senses the light and thinks it's daytime again, so it shuts off the light. When the light shuts off, the photocell senses that it's dark again and turns the light back on. Then it keeps cycling on and off. Each cycle lasts about a minute or two depending on the manufacturer of the photocell. This usually happens with the streelight is near a shiny marble wall or a building window.",science_mathematics

"What are some good books to read that deal with brain activity and disorders associated with the brain? A book may have been mentioned in the film the Exorcism of Emily Rose that deals with this. Any books that reveal brain operations and religion also would be appreciated. There are a number of good books, but I think which one you will enjoy is largely dependent on your background in neurobiology.  There are, however, some books that deal with the problem of a more understandable level, in case you have no training in the field.  Of those I would recommend Oliver Sacks' ""The Man Who Mistook His Wife For A Hat"".  Sacks is a neurologists who describes some of his most interesting cases.  Aside from the insight you will get into mental diseases and brain functions, what is more Sacks writes with real compassion for his patients.  There are also the books by Joseph LeDoux (""The Emotional Brain""; ""Synaptic Self"") and Antonio Damasio (""Descartes' Error""; ""The Feeling of What Happens"").  LeDoux and Damasio address such important questions as emotions, feelings, and self-consciousness.  All of these books are a fun read even if you are not a biologist.  \n\nHope that helps.",science_mathematics
"Why did we create dark matter? Posit: According to most working astrophysists, a galaxy simply cannont exist if all of its visible matter are its sole ingredients.  To make sense of this, if any, scientists created ""dark matter"" to make up the extra gravity a galaxy needed to exist.  BUT!  if Einstein is correct (e=mc2), the galaxy's energy must almost contribute to the gravity that galaxy has to work with, right? Web links, books, authors, et al. would be greatly appreciated. In cosmology, dark matter refers to matter of yet unknown composition, that does not emit or reflect enough light to be detected directly. But its presence may be inferred from gravitational effects on visible matter such as stars and galaxies.\n\nEvidence suggest that there is much more dark matter than visible matter. As it is non-interacting with light it must be of non-baryonic origin. It also must be stable, because it exists since the Big Bang, 14 billion years ago. The only candidate among the elementary particles we know already are the neutrinos. However there are theories like Supersymmetry that predict other particles, that would fit the known data.",science_mathematics

If you define ""getting bigger"" as turning gaseous matter (air) and turning into solid (rotting leaves and dead trees + rotting animal bodies and waste), then this is an interesting question, and the answer may be yes.  What we now see as carbon fuels (petroleum, coal, etc.) are the accumulated solids of all the biomass (life) that has ever lived on the planet.  I.e. the mass of a tree + all the leaves it has shed in its lifetime, is way more than the amount of solid nutrients it has absorbed from the soil as it includes tons of solid carbon that was extracted from CO2 in the atmosphere during photosynthesis (and green algae are doing the same in the oceans).  Animals are doing the opposite, eating plants, breathing in O2, and expelling gaseous CO2 back into the atmosphere (as well as a few other obnoxious gasses).  Not to mention the fact that humans are mounting a rather agressive campaign of digging up that old Carbon sludge (oil) and burning it back into the atmosphere as CO2 and CO (carbon monoxide) and even more obnoxious gasses.\n\nSo I don't know which process is faster, the fixing of solid carbon from gaseous CO2 by plants, or the conversion of solid carbon back to gaseous CO2 by animals and Ford Explorers.",science_mathematics

Look for information on the Human Bot Fly, there are a lot of images, and they are nasty.\nThe genus Dermatobia contains only one species, D. hominis, the only species of bot fly that attacks humans (in addition to other primates). It is also known as the torsalo. In this species the fly's eggs are vectored by mosquitoes and muscoid flies; the female Dermatobia captures the fly and attaches its eggs to the body of the fly, then releases it. The eggs hatch either while the mosquito is feeding and the larvae may use the mosquito bite area as the entry point, or simply drop off the muscoid fly when it lands on the skin. They develop inside the subcutaneous layers, and after approximately 8 weeks they drop out to pupate for at least a week, typically in the soil. The adults are small gray flies resembling a blowfly.\n\nThis species is native to the New World tropics, though it is not abundant enough (nor harmful enough) to ever attain true pest status. Since the fly larvae can only survive the entire eight week development if the wound does not become infected, it is rare for patients to experience infections, unless they kill the larva without removing it completely (below).

"why is 4-methoxybenzoic acid less acidic than 4-fluorobenzoic acid?  Okay, first picture a benzene ring - six carbons, flat topology thanks to its aromaticity.  By definition, the benzene carbon with the carboxylic acid group attached is carbon #1.  So, you have two cases here, both with a ring substituent ""para"" (or directly opposite) the carboxylic acid.  Everybody on the same page?\n\nNow, acidity is defined, in simple terms, as the willingness of a molecule to give up a proton, aka an H+ ion.  The more easily it will part with that H+, the more acidic a compound is.  So, the question, really, is what makes a proton stay stuck to an acid?\n\nA carboxylic acid anion (COO-) has a large electron density delocalized between its two oxygen atoms.  A hydrogen ion will tend to stay stuck to this negatively charged group to balance out it's negative charge.  In layman's terms, a carboxylic acid is more comfortable with a positively charged bit hanging around to make all those nonbonding electrons on the oxygens less unwieldy.  \n\nWith your two compounds, the difference between them is the substituent in the 4 position.  Remember that an aromatic system like this has a flat electron cloud above and below the ring, and this electron cloud will interact directly with any ring substituents.  \n\nThe methoxy group is an electron donor.  It is not, overall, very electronegative, so it will tend to ""push"" its electron density into the benzene ring, and that will tend to prevent the  carboxylate group from sharing its negative charge density with the aromatic system.  With the negative charge localized to the carboxylate, it will be difficult for the hydrogen ion to dissociate, and 4-methoxybenzoic acid will be very weak.  \n\nFluorine, on the other hand, is an excellent  electron sink; it is one of the most electronegative substituents you can put on a benzene ring.  It will tend to draw electron density towards itself, allowing the carboxylate to push some of its negative charge into the aromatic ring.  The negative charge, then, will be more delocalized, making it easier for the acidic proton to dissociate from the carboxylate group.  4-fluorobenzoic acid will, therefore, be a stronger acid than 4-methoxybenzoic acid.\n\nDoes that make sense?  I hope this helps.",science_mathematics

"what are the 6th. , 7th. ...12th dimentions? I heared that there is more than 4 dimentions\nwhat are they? Basically, the space that you and I experiences daily is 3 dimensions: up/down, left/right, forward/backwards. But space doesn't have to be 3 dimensions. It can be any number of dimensions. Of course, it is very difficult for us 3-dimensional beings to imagine what these dimensions are, or where they are. The problems is that we can NEVER see the fourth spatial dimension, never mind the 5th or the 6th, etc. etc. Let me explain why.\n\nImagine for a moment that we are 2-d beings, not 3-d. And we live on the surface of a sphere (like a ballon). This sphere is our universe. Everything we see, touch and experience happens on the surface of this sphere. We can go left/right and forward/backwards. But we can never go up or down. When we travel in one direction, we will eventually circumnavigate the sphere and make a complete circle, which brings us back to the initial starting point. If we ask the 2-d beings to imagine 3-dimensional space, all we can tell them is that the 3rd dimension (up/down) is orthogonal (a fancy way of saying perpendicular) to the surface of the sphere.\n\nThis is exactly our situation when we talk about the 4th, 5th, 6th, whatever nth dimension. They are defined as the dimension that is orthogonal to the n-1 th space. So the 4th dimension is orthogonal to our 3-dimensional space, and the 5th dimension is orthogonal to the 4-dimensional space, etc. etc.\n\nNow about Super String Theory and these higher dimensions: what the theory predicts is that our universe does indeed have more than 3 spatial dimensions. Some version sof the theory say there are 10, some say there are 11. Whatever the number (it doesn't really matter in our discussion here), these higher spatial dimensions are currently curled up into very very tiny spaces. So what does that mean?\n\nWe now go back to our 2-d being living on a sphere example. For the time being, let's say we are now on a flat 2-dimensional surface (like a sheet of paper). Super String Theory says that the higher dimensions are curled up. So let's consider in our case the 3rd dimension as the curled up dimension. This means that if we were to magnify any point on the 2-d surface all the way to about 10^-35 meters (Planck Length), we will see that there is a tiny loop (like a loose thread on a knitted sweater).\n\nNow imagine if our 2-d being were (1) small enough to see and fit inside the loop, and (2) able now to travel in the 3rd dimension, then for it to go in the up/down direction, the 2-d being will now be just going around in circles inside the loop. Remember in the previous case, our 2-d being can travel in one direction on the surface of the sphere and then return to the same point. Well, here our 2-d being is traversing through the 3rd dimension, except that there is no up and down because the 3rd dimension is ""curled up"" into a loop. So the 2-d being just goes around the loop in circles.\n\nIf you understood the above, then now we can answer the question, what and where are these higher dimensions in our universe. They are culred up in every point in our 3-dimensional space, and if we were small enough and we could move into these higher dimensions, then we would be moving through these very convoluted curled up loops, but not really able to go anywhere.\n\nBecause these higher dimensions are curled up into such tiny tiny loops (remember 10^-35 meters), only the most elementary structures like ""strings"" are affected by them. The size of these strings are of course on the order of 10^-35 meters long, and can traverse through the curl up dimensions. When the strings vibrate, the vibrations in the 3 large dimensions don't have any effect, but in the curled up higher dimensions, the vibrations can create resonance like playing a musical note.\n\nThese resonances are the stuff of reality, meaning these vibrational resonances of the strings inside the curled up dimensions is what creates matter and energy and thus everything that&#",science_mathematics

"what is pulse - field gel electrophoresis? in molecular biological technique Think of a gel as a web of fibers, either polyacylamide or acrose.

The molecules are very long and fiber-like.  They have a tendency to get hung up on the fibers of the gel.  Pulse field electrophoresis provides a solution.\n\nIn pulse field electophoresis, the voltage difference across the gel is reversed repeatedly to prevent the problem of the molecules getting stuck on the fibers of the gel.  Initially, the positive charge is placed at the bottom of the gel.  As the DNA moves to the positive end, some of the molecules will get hung up.  So, at some point in time, the field is reversed so the positive charge is at the top of the gel.  The DNA molecules then move to the top of the gel.  Any hung up molecules are then freed.  Then the field is reversed again, so the molecules can continue their journey to the bottom of the gel.  The process is repeated several time throughout a gel run.",science_mathematics
"If the universe is infinite, there also exist thousands of Earth with billions of people like us am I right ?

"write down the word equation that defines the magnitute of force.?  A force is a push or pull on an object.\n\nNewton's second law states that a an applied force causes an object to accelerate.  It's one of the most if not the most powerful physics equations.  Force equals mass times acceleration.  F=ma.  So when an object falls the force of an object is equal to the mass of the object times the acceleration due to Earth's gravity (9.81 m/s/s or 9.81 meters per second per second or meters per second squared.)  All objects experience the same acceleration due to gravity.  The units for force are, oddly enough, called Newtons and one newton equals one kilogram times one meter per second squared.  One pound is 4.48 newtons. \n\nNow it's important to understand that newton's second law, F=ma, applies to net forces or unbalanced forces.  Just because an object is moving doesn't mean it's accelerating.  When you press the accelerator you car speeds up and the engine is exerting a net force on the car.  When your speed maxes out at 120 or however fast your car can go the force of the engine is ballanced against the forces against the car (friction from air, the road and the engine parts)  \n\nTake tug of war.  An set of even matched teams won't result in one team moving across the line.  The forces are balanced.  Add one more strong guy to one team and the weaker team will speed up from zero to slowly moving across the line.  \n\nAlso force is cumulative.  When you can't pick up a heavy box what do you do?  You get help.  One smurf can lift a pebble but the whole smurf village can lift a boulder.\n\nAlso acceration is velocity divided by time a velocity is different from speed in that velocity is a vector, it has magnitude (speed) and direction.  If you change directions you will accelerate.\n\nIf you're in a train with no windows and an increadibly smooth track you shouldn't be able to tell that you are moving if the train't velocity is constant, however if it speeds up, slows down or goes around a corner while going at a constant speed the velocity is changing.  In the first two cases because of a change in magnitude (speed) in the last case because of a change in direction and you experience a force that pushes or pulls you in a direction.\n\nWeight is the force due to gravity and can change due to the masses of the objects involved.  For example you may have a weight of 100 lbs on earth and a mass of 40 some kilograms but on the moon you weigh 1/6 as much but still have a mass of 40 kg.  On Earth you can convert between pounds (a measure of force) and kilograms (a measure of mass) because the acceleration due to Earth's gravity (9.81 meters per second squared) is the same and cancels out in the equation.",science_mathematics

Therefore, getting more work out of a machine than is put into it is not possible.  In practical terms, even 100% efficiency, which would be getting an equal amount of work output, is not possible since some energy will always be lost due to forces such as friction.  Two terms describing the state where work output is greater than work input are ""perpetual motion"" and ""free energy.""  Unfortunately, neither one can exist.",science_mathematics

"Calculate the surface of an egg??? As there is easter coming up I wonder if it is possible to calculate the surface of an ""egg""?? \nI already know the surface area of a sphere is  4*Pi*r^2,  where  r  stands for the radius of the sphere, and Pi is the constant approximately equal to 3.14159\n\nAn egg shaped thingy probaly has got a mathematical term to, but my math skills are somewhat lacking...\n\nSO PLEASE, \npretty please \njust tell me in simple english how the surface would be calculated \n(e.g. cut into ellipses? what measures would be needed?)\n\nMany thanks in advance :) I have to admit, when I look at your other questions, I wonder how serious you are. You look like a bit of a joker. How do I know you won't just delete this question if I help you?\n- - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nI have gone back to look at this question. Contrary to what others have said, this question has been examined over and over and there is a substantial literature on it. The size and shape of eggs is very interesting to people in the poultry industry, and those who must develop machinery that interacts with eggs, as well as environmentalists and others. \n\nThere are several problems here clearly. One is, there is no uniform shape to an egg. Different animals and different species produce different-shaped eggs.\n\nThe second is, there is no easy formula available for an egg shape that is well-known.\n\n\nThat said, there are lots of approximation and estimation methods available, as well as lots of experimental data and tables for different kinds of eggs. \n\nIn general, for eggs that are rotationally symmetric about an axis, the surface area \n\nA= 2*pi* {int from a to b} y(x) * sqrt[1+y'(x)] dx\n\nwhere y(x) is the curve describing the boundary of the egg, \na<=x<=b. If y(x) is analytic, then this integral can be done analytically. If not, it can be done numerically, as done by one of the references. \n\nIn the case of hen's eggs, T. C. Carter (1968) produced a 3 parameter model for computing surface area (""The hen's egg: A mathematical model with three parameters"", Brit. Poulty Sci. 9, 165-171, 1968). In 1949, Romanoff, A. L., and A. J. Romanoff published a book with many formulae and approximation methods for egg surface areas called ""The\navian egg"" (John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York, 1949).\n\nOne of the references approximates the egg as a prolate spheroid to compute its surface area. \n \nSome of the references produce empirical formulae for the volume and surface areas of various shapes of eggs. For example, the abstract by V. G. Narushin in the references presents the presumably empirically fit-model of egg surface area, S, calculated as S = (3.155 – 0.0136L + 0.0115B)LB, in which both L and B are taken in millimeters (obviously there is a problem with the units here). \n\nOne of the other references presents some empirically-derived formulae relating weight W of the egg to its surface area A that appear to fit quite closely (for example, A=4.835*W^0.662).\n\nI think that once you decide exactly what sort of egg you are interested in, there is a wealth of material available to investigate this further.",science_mathematics
"Can anyone define String Theory in a sentence?  This might not be one sentence, but might help in understanding the concept easily. \n\nOk...now...in simpler terms..\nWe all are familiar with an atom. Atom is made up of core nucleus and electrons around the nucleus. If you look inside the Nucleus, you will find protons and neurtons. If you further look inside protons and neutrons, you will have quazars. We were stuck there until the string theory came along. Now...Sting theory suggests that quazars has something inside and that is nothing but a vibrating string of energy(light), which gives it the structure. \n\nSo in sense, its like saying..we have different atoms because deep inside, the string of engery is vibrating with different nodes. Difference in string vibrations is what gives difference in structure of atoms from inside, which is translated outside. Its an interesting concept. \nBoth scientists and philosophers are equally interested in this because string theory says that it all boils down to the vibrations of strings of energy in the subatomic level. So that is like saying....matter might look solid but deep inside, its just energy...more like an invisible light. \nHope this explanation helps. Ofcourse there is more to it than what i explained. There is tons of mathematical calculations and revolutionary ideas in quantum physics that goes with string theory. They are still working on it. Try watching ""The elegant universe"". It was originally aired in PBS, but i guess you can buy it in bookstores like Barnes&Nobels. Its fantastic. You can understand it easily since they show animations of it.",science_mathematics

"question, no idea wat to do plz help? In a “Rotor-ride” at a carnival, people are rotated in a cylindrically walled “room”. The room radius is 4.6 m, and the rotation frequency is 0.50 revolutions per second when the floor drops out. What is the minimum coefficient of static fric-tion so that the people will not slip down? The force of static friction is the product of the force normal to the surface and the coefficient of friction. This force must be greater than or equal to the passenger's weight. First, we find the acceleration:\n\na = v²/r = ω²r, where ω is the angular velocity in rad/s\nω=.5 rev/s = π rad/s\na=4.6π² m/s² ≈ 45.40018 m/s²\n\nThe normal force producing this acceleration is:\nF = ma = m*4.6π² m/s²\nSo the maximum force of static friction is:\nμ*m*4.6π² m/s²\n\n(Note: those units are correct - I'm not writing the kg because the units of mass are contained in the term for mass - if I were to substitute a particular mass, I would get something like μ*(60 kg) * 4.6π² m/s², so writing kg a second time would be redundant).\n\nNow, the weight of a passenger is:\nF=mg ≈ m*9.81 m/s²\n\nSo we have:\nμ*m*4.6π² m/s² ≥ m*9.81 m/s²\n\ndividing by m*4.6π² m/s:\n\nμ ≥ 0.216079\n\nHowever, since our initial values were only given to two significant digits:\n\nμ ≥ 0.22",science_mathematics

"When you get a blood transfusion, does the DNA of all that blood eventually match up to yours? And what about organ transplants, does their DNA stay exactly the same forever? Blood is composed of red blood cells and plasma.  Red blood cells are responsible for carying oxygen.  They don't have a nucleus, and thus, no DNA, and also do not have mitochondria, so no mitochondrial DNA, either.  So, no DNA, no problem.\n\nBlood typing is based on the presence of A and B protiens on the surface of the red blood cell, and the Rh factor (another protien).  AB+ people can accept all blood types, while O- people can donate to any blood type (making their blood highly valuable to blood banks.) Blood type B is by far the most common in world demographics. \n\nPeople are matched on blood type for both blood transfusions and organ transplants.  Plus, for organ transplants they also look at the donor/recipeint histocompatability, which is basically the antigens the bodies of the people involved produce.  Foreign antigens trigger the body's immune response, so finding people with the same antigens helps avoid rejection, as well as drug treatments.\n\nIn short, no matter what you add to your body from another person, the DNA is never ""changed"".

"I want Obsessive-Compulsive treatment from Herbal in India.Is it possible? I am suffering from Obsessive-Compulsive Dissorder from last 10 years. no cure, no herbal treatment, but there is psychological approach, please read below.\n\nSome common obsessions include:\n\nFear of being contaminated by germs or dirt \nFear of causing harm to oneself or others \nIntrusive sexually explicit or violent thoughts and images \nExcessive focus on religious or moral ideas \nFear of losing or not having things you might need \nOrder and symmetry: the idea that everything must line up “just right.” \nSuperstitions: excessive attention to something considered lucky or unlucky \nSome common compulsive behaviors are:\n\nexcessive double-checking \ncounting \nhand washing \ncleaning \nordering/arranging \ntouching \npraying \nhoarding \n\n\nWhat treatment is available for OCD?\nOCD is not usually curable, but it is highly treatable, in that effective treatment can greatly reduce the occurrence of obsessive thoughts and compulsive rituals. A combination of behavior therapy and medication seems to offer the best long-term improvement. \n\nExposure Treatment and Response Prevention\nA type of behavioral therapy called exposure and response prevention is generally the first line of treatment for OCD.  In this treatment, you are repeatedly exposed to the source of your obsession. Then you are prevented from engaging in whatever compulsive ritual you use to reduce the anxiety brought about by your obsession. For example, if you are a compulsive hand washer, you might be asked to touch the door handle in a public restroom and then be prevented from washing up. As you sit with the anxiety, the urge to wash your hands will gradually begin to go away on its own. In this way, you learn that you don’t need the ritual to get rid of your anxiety.\n\nExposure treatment and response prevention is carefully planned out and controlled, with your therapist at your side to provide support. You will begin with a situation that provokes only a low level of anxiety. Once you’ve been exposed to this situation and have waited out the anxiety without engaging in your compulsion, you will move on to a more challenging situation. Continuing with the previous example, you might progress from touching the bathroom door handle to touching the toilet flush lever or even the toilet seat itself. With each successful exposure and response prevention, you’ll feel a greater sense of control over your obsessions and compulsions. Studies show that exposure and response prevention can actually “retrain” the brain to function differently, permanently reducing the occurrence of OCD symptoms. This type of behavioral therapy can even extinguish compulsive behaviors entirely.\n\nAccording to the Academy of Cognitive Therapy, 75% of people who complete exposure and response prevention treatment experience improvement of their OCD symptoms.\nFor more information about this behavioral treatment, read What Is Exposure & Response Prevention? and Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP).\n\nCognitive Therapy\nA cognitive component is often combined with the behavioral approach of exposure and response prevention. Cognitive therapy targets the OCD sufferer’s catastrophic thoughts and exaggerated sense of responsibility. According to OCD Action, “Cognitive therapy suggests that OCD results when an individual misinterprets intrusive thoughts or urges as a sign that not only will harm occur, but that they may be responsible for it through what they do or what they fail to do.” Therefore, a central task of therapy is to address these irrational thoughts and challenge them. See Treatments for OCD: Cognitive Therapy for an overview of the cognitive approach and useful treatment tools, including thought records. For more on how OCD leads to biased and unproductive ways of thinking, visit Cognitive Therapy for OCD: What It is, When to Use It and When Not! \n\nTo review the main ideas involved in a combined cognitive-behavioral approach to OCD treatment, read OCD-UK’s What is Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT)?\n\nMedication\n",science_mathematics

"How dou make a 3-D topographic map? I have to do this science project to make a model of a topographic map & i dont know how to make it. Can someone plz help me out. I assume you mean a physical topagraphic map, not a digital one.  If so, this is one way that might work for you:\n\nFirst, you need a topagraphic map of the area you want to make...i.e. one that shows elevation changes.  Now, you want one that is big enough for your project and a way to copy it and / or enlarge / shrink it if you need to.\n\nSecondly, you will need lots of thick poster board, the kind that has the styrofoam like backing, or in a pinch, thick cardboard from a few boxes would work fine too, but something that will be fairly easy to cut.  You will need at least one sheet that will be the base (i.e. the lowest elevation)\n\nLook at your map and see the highest point and the lowest point and what elevation (i.e. change in height) each topagraphic line on the map represents.  Trace out each elevation onto a separate sheet of posterboard.  Or if you want, make lots of copies of the map and cut out each elevation and glue it to a separate piece of poster board.  REMEMBER:  write down the elevation on the board or else you won't know which layer it will belong later!\n\nNow carefully with an Exacto knife or what ever sharp object you might have, cut out each elevation from the boards, starting with the lowest above the base, then glue it to the base.  Then cut out the next layer and glue it to the appropriate area and so on. When you are done, you should end up with a model that looks just like the original topagraphic map but in 3D.\n\nThough it is not necessary, for greater accuracy and difficulty, you could make the thickness changes be in scale to the map.  For example, if 1/4 inch is the equal to a distance of 500 feet on the map, then each 1/4 inch layer should represent a rise of 500 feet above the base.  Whatever you do, just be consistent, and the map should look great.\n\nI hope that helps! :-)",science_mathematics

If the force of friction is 20N, approximately how far does the block travel before it stops?? Please Explain!! Thanks. Well the first thing to do in a problem like this is extract information from it.\n1.) Weight of Block = 10kg\n2.) Velocity of block(Vi) = 6m/s\n3.) Final velocity of block(Vf) = 0m/s\n4.) Friction acting on block = 20N The friction is always opposite of the direction of the block.\n\nSecond:\nWhat are we calculating? Distance traveled by block! DISTANCE.  We need a formula that will give us distance as an answer! So...we have final velocity, initial velocity, and distance....lets see...how about this one...\n vf^(2) = vi^(2) + 2*a*d \n\nThis equation has Vf, Vi, and D.  \nVf = 0 m/s\nVi = 6 m/s\nD = What we are trying to find.\nThe only thing missing in this equation that we have to find is (a) or acceleration. Hmm.\n\nThere is actually acceleration on  the block.  Friction is acting on the block in the opposite direction; therefore the block is decelerating.  We can use F=ma to find the force of deceleration.\nFriction Force = 20N\nMass = 10kg\nAcceleration = ?\n\nUse the following equation:\nF=ma\n1.) -20N = 10kg * a\n2.) a = -2 m/s (Yes it's negative b/c we are decelerating!)\n\nNow we go back to the original problem!\n vf^(2) = vi^(2) + 2*a*d \n\nThus\n(0^2) = (6^2) + (2)*(-2)*(d)\n0 = 36 - 4d\n-36 = -4d.\nDistance = 9meters!

He is using the energy equations to calculate energy in the block. When the block is in motion there is Kinetic Energy in it.  When the block has no motion, there is zero Kinetic Energy in it.  However, the individual that did this messed up the equation as follows:\nKe = (1/2) * Mass * Velocity^2\n\nThus the answer is not 18 but 9 meters!!!!!\nHere is the correction:\n1.) .5*mass x (velocity)^2 = Force x distance\n2.) .5*10kg*(6m/s)^2 = 20N * x distance\n3.)

H-bonding is stronger than Van der Waals forces - for example in methane CH4 (16g/mol), which is gas at room temperature. Besides, water is unique because its oxygen atom has two lone pairs and two hydrogen atoms, meaning that the total number of H-bonds of a water molecule is up to four.

However, even this telescope, as powerful as it is, could not possibly see the flag left on the moon.\n\nUsing a little math and common sense, it would not nearly be possible to see the flag on the moon with the Hubble space telescope.\n\nFirst, let’s get some basic facts straight.\nThe Diameter of the Hubble telescope is 2.4 meters and the distance from the Earth to the moon (on average) is about 3.84 E8 meters.\n\nPretty much the only thing limiting what Hubble can and cannot resolve is diffraction through a circular aperture (i.e. how light waves interact with each other when they get to Hubble's mirror.\nThe minimum angle which a circular aperture can resolve is given by the formula,\nTheta_min = 1.22 Lambda / D\nwhere Theta min is the minimum angle, Lambda is the wavelength of light we are using, and D is the diameter of the opening.\n\nIf we assume we are using light at 500 nm (roughly the middle of the visible spectrum) and we know that Hubble's diameter is 2.4 meters, we can find the minimum angle to be,\nTheta_min = 2.54 E-7 radians.\nThis is quite a small angle by Earthly standards, but will it compare to the angle to the flag on the moon?...we'll see.\n\nHere is where I have to make an assumption, but it is a very reasonable assumption and one that will assure us that out answer is correct. Watching the moon landing videos, one can see that the astronauts placed a moderately sized flag on a pole on the moon. Although I don’t know the exact dimensions of the flag, I can assure you, it was definitely no bigger than 10 ft. But for the sake of argument and to make the numbers easier, let’s assume it was 10 feet (~3 meters).\nIf the distance between the flag and Hubble is the same (about) as the distance from the Earth to the moon, then we can calculate the angle between the top of the flag and the bottom of the flag pole as seen by Hubble orbiting Earth. The angle comes out to be about, 7.81 E-9 radians, about 30 times SMALLER than the absolute minimum angle Hubble can resolve...and this is if we assume that the flag is 10 ft, which it obviously is smaller than that in reality.\n\nPlus, Hubble was specifically designed to look at VERY distant object. Although the moon is far away, it might as well be right next to us compared to the stars/galaxies/.. Hubble is supposed to be looking at. Therefore, I don’t know exactly how it will respond looking at such a close and bright object.\n\nOne this is sure through, you could not see the flag, even with one of the best telescopes ever built operating perfectly under ideal conditions using visible light.",science_mathematics
"I need help solving: 2x^5-8x^4+7x^3-10x^2+10x-5 for maximum, minimum, and inflection points.  HOW? i have no clue of how to solve this thing. The first derivative of this is\n\n10x^4 - 32x^3 + 21x^2 - 20x + 10\n\nSet that equal to zero and solve for the FOUR solutions. That will give you the x values of the four turning points that are the maxima and minima of the original equation. \n\nThe second derivative will serve two purposes. It will enable to you to find the thtree inflection points, and also enable you to tell which of the four turning points of the curve are maxima and which of them are minima.\n\nThe second derivative is \n\n40x^3 - 96x^2 + 42x - 20\n\nSet that equal to zero and solve. The three solutions give you the x-values of the three inflection points. To use the second derivative to find which turning points are maxima and which are minima, plug in the value of x for each turning point into the second derivative. If the value of the second derivative is positive, the turning point in a minimum. If it is negative, the turning point is a maximum.",science_mathematics

"A Magnet Question? I am at my workbench and bored , so i;m doing a little experiment. I have one allan key and one magnet, when I move the maget close to the allan key there is no attraction, until I get a certain distance away,(say 2 cm's for aguements sake) then the allan key zooms towards the magnet so fast I cannot pull the magnet away fast enough.\n\nThis happens as well if i go really really slow, no attraction then bamm, the allan key is stuck to the magnet.\nHow comes I cant get to a distance where the allan key is slowly attracted to the magnet, so i can pull the magnet away and they both move at the same speed. There's two reasons for the sudden ""leap"" of your allen key towards the magnet.\n\nFirstly, magnetic force is proportional to the inverse square of the distance over which it acts.  (to put it another way, if you halve the distance, the force is quadrupled).\n\nSecondly, the friction force between your allen key and the bench becomes much less when the allen key starts moving (this is called mu (mew) slip).\n\nYes, it is possible to maintain a distance which will continually pull the allen key along.  It's a case of balancing the force of attraction from the magnet and the friction force. This is a whole lot easier to do if the friction force is proportional to the speed of movement, so that the faster it goes the more force there is holding it back.  One way to achieve this is to put your allen key in a little boat on some water.\n\nBest regards.",science_mathematics

"Whats so good nutritionally, about not-made-from-concentrate juices? I understand why concentrates are used - for shipping, etc...  But is there any real difference nutritionally / chemically between rehydrated concentrate or the natural thing? The answer to this question would depend entirely upon the juice and its vitamin constituents, and their survivability in a hydrated versus concentrated state.  Some nutrients cannot or have difficulty surviving outside of liquid suspension, resulting in their chemical breakdown.  This also applies to non-nutritional components which although will not change the nutritional level of the food or beverage, it can most definitely modify its taste or texture.  This is why many concentrated or dehydrated foods taste very different than ""fresh"" equivalents.\n\nOn the other hand, some vitamins can maintain their structure even better when concentrated.  I mention this because it is widely accepted that ascorbic acid (vitamin C) is one of these, and is probably the one with which people are most concerned when asking about juice concentrates.  It is widely accepted that ascorbic acid degrades over time in fresh and NFC juices, but degrades more slowly (probably due to its frozen state) in from-concentrate products.",science_mathematics

However, Mark Twain had a point when he said ""The coldest Winter I ever spent was Summer in San Francisco.""\nThis is because the warm air from inland (where it gets quite hot in the Summer) clashes with the cold air from the surrounding Pacific Ocean and the SF Bay. When that happens, fog forms. Further explanation from http://kids.earth.nasa.gov: ""At night, the ground surface cools by radiating heat to space. Air near the ground cools to the dew point temperature, causing water in the air to condense.""\nSure it's cold, but fog can be quite beautiful and atmospheric.

"how do aliens travel so long distance to reach the earth? if aliens do travel very long distances then they must be going faster than the speed of light which violates our law,right? Aliens travel through wormholes, meaning they don't fly long distances to get to earth. \n\n""Intra-universe wormholes connect one location of a universe to another location of the same universe(in the same present time). A wormhole should be able to connect distant locations in the universe by bending spacetime, allowing travel between them that is faster than it would take light to make the journey through normal space. See the image above. Inter-universe wormholes connect one universe with another [1], [2]. This gives rise to the speculation that such wormholes could be used to travel from one parallel universe to another. A wormhole which connects (usually closed) universes is often called a Schwarzschild wormhole. Another application of a wormhole might be time travel. In that case it is a shortcut from one point in space and time to another. In string theory a wormhole has been envisioned to connect two D-branes, where the mouths are attached to the branes and are connected by a flux tube [3]. Finally, wormholes are believed to be a part of spacetime foam [4]. There are two main types of wormholes: Lorentzian wormholes and Euclidean wormholes. Lorentzian wormholes are mainly studied in semiclassical gravity and Euclidean wormholes are studied in particle physics. Traversable wormholes are a special kind of Lorentzian wormholes which would allow a human to travel from one side of the wormhole to the other. Sergey Krasnikov tossed the term spacetime shortcut as a more general term for (traversable) wormholes and propulsion systems like the Alcubierre drive and the Krasnikov tube to indicate hyperfast interstellar travel.""",science_mathematics

Very slow, which are highly vascularized and have amazing endurance, intermediate, which are sort of a mix, and fast, which are explosive-but, to some degree all are involved in anything.

For slow fibres, an excellent overall cardiovascular fitness regimen is sufficient-you dont need to do anything specifically for the arm and shoulder muscles for slow fibres.  The best weightlifting regimen for this kind of sport is explosive speed/strength training, in which you use 30-50% of the maximum weight you can lift (for any given movement), and accelerate it quickly through as large a range of motion as you can-  It takes some months to build up to a really fast acceleration, because this training has a potential to cause muscle tears and joint damage (just like strength training of any kind).

"Isn't the healthiest cure for high cholesterol levels simply to become vegan?  Why is this never mentioned? I see advertisements on TV about prescription drugs that purport to lower cholesterol levels, as well as medications that can be taken with food to block the absorption of saturated fat and reduce the presence of cholesterol in the body.  From what I've heard, there are some considerable, negative side effects to this all, one example being liver damage.\n\nSo, I looked up what the ""high cholesterol"" and high saturated fat foods are. From what I can tell, nearly all of them are animal products (egg yolks, animal organs, butter, etc.).\n\nI've never seen anything in the news media, though, about this.  I would think it'd be pretty obvious that the easiest way to avoid a high cholesterol condition is to simply (duh?) avoid eating food that's bad for you like animal products.\n\nSo my questions are these:\n- Am I accurate in saying that most high cholesterol foods are animal based?\n- Why is there so little said about the benefits of a vegan diet to remedy this condition? Cholesterol is only in animal foods...there are plant sterols, but they are NOT the negative animal cholesterol.  Although it is true that cholesterol is made by your body (as you do need some for vital bodily functions), adding cholesterol in your diet is definitely one of the major problems with the ""bad"" cholesterol that causes problems.  Saturated fat (which is in plant and animal products, but more so in animal products) also plays a part in cholesterol production:  if you have too much saturated fat, it is turned into cholesterol by your body.  There have been studies that show that a vegan diet not only helps with high cholesterol, but also many cancers, many autoimmune disorders, asthma, allergies, etc.  Since there  are obviously people who have been brainwashed by the meat/dairy/egg industries, you don't hear much about vegan diets as all the propoganda spewed about how ""unhealthy"" these diets are.

"what are the organs associated with the male reproductive system?  Male reproductive organs or male reproductive system \n\nThe main reproductive organs of the male body are the testes, which produce sperm and also male hormones, in the form of testosterone. The male reproductive system also includes the external genitals — the penis and the scrotum — and the internal structures, including the prostate gland, the vas deferentia (plural for the 2 vas deferens), the urethra, and the seminal vesicles.\n\nTestes\nThe paired oval testes, also known as the male gonads, hang in the scrotal sac. Usually the right testis hangs higher than the left one by about 1 cm. The testes hang outside the body because the temperature inside the body is too high to produce sperm, so they are produced in the testes at about 3 °C lower than body temperature.\n\nEpididymis\nAt the back of the olive-shaped body of each testis is a cap formed by the many coils of a 20-foot long tube called the epididymis. The function of the epididymis is to collect the immature sperm from the testis.\n\nAs the sperm make their long journey through the epididymis they become mature sperm. This journey takes about 20 days and during its course the sperm become fertile and they also become able to move in a swimming motion (doctors refer to the sperm then as ‘motile’).\n\nVas deferens\nJoined to the epididymis is the vas deferens — a thick walled tube which transports sperm from the epididymis up to the prostate gland. The section of the vas deferens that is above the testis can be felt through the loose part of the scrotum. When a vasectomy is performed, it is this part of the vas deferens that is snipped.\n\nThe vas deferens empties into the ejaculatory duct, which passes through the prostate gland to merge with the urethra.\n\nThe urethra\nThe urethra serves as the tube down which urine passes from the bladder through the penis to the outside and also the tube down which semen is ejaculated.\n\nThe prostate\nThe prostate is a walnut-shaped gland that surrounds the urethra. Along with the seminal vesicles it produces the fluid secretions that support and nourish the sperm. Without this fluid to dilute them the sperm cannot move easily.\n\nAfter the age of 40 the prostate enlarges and can press on the urethra. An enlarged prostate is often the cause of urinary problems in older men.",science_mathematics

Probably not so fine (think ozone layer).\n\nRadioactive decay is deterministic and measuring it is deterministic (you can conclusively point to a number that directly relates to decay rate), but radioactive dating (of which carbon dating is just one type) is based on the probability of carbon decay.  It assumes C-14 will decay at a specific rate.  The likelihood of this probability is very high to about 50,000-100,000 years, at which point there is too much uncertainty in the assumption and too little decay to measure accurately.  This is why they do not use carbon dating for dinosaur fossils, for example.",science_mathematics

"Why is someone more likely to bleed to death when an artery is cleanly severed rather than crushed or torn?  A cleanly severed vessel is less likely to clot, therefore less likely to stop the blood flow. A crushed or mangled vessel has more places for the clot to form, so it could potentially stop the bleeding. Think of it like a garden hose - a nice clean cut gets a lot of water thrugh it. A mangled end still lets water out, but it impedes the flow. The slower the flow, the better chance of clotting (plus a slower flow means less blood loss).",science_mathematics

He determines and  designs the size and thickness of the casing and wellhead, according to the depth, pressure, and production capabilities of the well, then determines the amount of cement needed to cement the casing in place.\n\nThen the completion of the well begins, and a workover rig is moved over the hole. In short, another wireline truck is moved over the hole, and holes are shot in the casing into the producing sand. The formation is then acidized and fractured hydraulically. If it produces, a production string of tubing is run in the hole.\n\nIf the well won't flow, then a pumping unit must be sized for the depth, production, etc.\n\nA tank battery is set up on location, including a separator, heater treater, and several tanks, depending on the amount of the production.\n\nLater in the life of the well, an engineer will be responsible for re-completing the well to another formation, or plugging and abandoning the well according to State regulations.\n\nA Production Operator is resposible for the production from several hundred wells, and when one stops producing, he must figure out why and get it bakc on line with the least of expense.",science_mathematics

"Who was Reimann?What was his hypothesis?  From Wikipedia.org: 'Georg Friedrich Bernhard Riemann (September 17, 1826 - July 20, 1866) (pronounced REE mahn or in IPA ['ri:man]) was a German mathematician who made important contributions to analysis and differential geometry, some of them paving the way for the later development of general relativity.\n\nIn mathematics, the Riemann hypothesis (also called the Riemann zeta-hypothesis), first formulated by Bernhard Riemann in 1859, is one of the most famous unsolved problems. It has been an open question for well over a century, despite attracting concentrated efforts from many outstanding mathematicians. Unlike some other celebrated problems, it is more attractive to professionals in the field than to amateurs.\n\nThe Riemann hypothesis is a conjecture about the distribution of the zeros of the Riemann zeta-function ζ(s). The Riemann zeta-function is defined for all complex numbers s ≠ 1. It has zeros at the negative even integers (i.e. at s = −2, s = −4, s = −6, ...). These are called the trivial zeros. The Riemann hypothesis is concerned with the non-trivial zeros, and states that:\n\nThe real part of any non-trivial zero of the Riemann zeta function is ½. \nThus the non-trivial zeros should lie on the so-called critical line ½ + it with t a real number and i the imaginary unit. The Riemann zeta-function along the critical line is sometimes studied in terms of the Z-function, whose real zeros correspond to the zeros of the zeta-function on the critical line.\n\n \nThe real part (red) and imaginary part (blue) of the critical line Re(s) = 1/2 of the Riemann zeta-function. You can see the first non-trivial zeros at Im(s) = ±14.135, ±21.022 and ±25.011. \nA polar graph of zeta, that is, Re(zeta) vs. Im(zeta), along the critical line s=it+1/2, with t running from 0 to 34The Riemann hypothesis is one of the most important open problems of contemporary mathematics; a $1,000,000 prize has been offered by the Clay Mathematics Institute for a proof. Most mathematicians believe the Riemann hypothesis to be true. (J. E. Littlewood and Atle Selberg have been reported as skeptical. Selberg's skepticism, if any, waned, from his young days. In a 1989 paper, he suggested that an analogue should hold for a much wider class of functions, the Selberg class.)'",science_mathematics

"Wot is RNA?  Ribonucleic acid (RNA) is a nucleic acid polymer consisting of covalently bound nucleotides. RNA nucleotides contain ribose rings and uracil unlike deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), which contains deoxyribose and thymine. It is transcribed from DNA by enzymes called RNA polymerases and further processed by other enzymes. RNA serves as the template for translation of genes into proteins, transferring amino acids to the ribosome to form proteins, and also translating the transcript into proteins.",science_mathematics
"why do you think the details of skeletal muscle and cardiac muscle contraction....? why do you think the details of skeletal muscle and cardiac muscle contraction are fairly well understood, but knowledge of contaction of smooth muscle is more limited? All of the above are well understood, it's just that skeletal and cardiac mucsle are more complicated, therefore there is more information on them.  Smooth muscle contraction can function solely on its intrinsic plexus, its built-in nervous system that only receives fine tuning from the para and sympathetic nervous systems.

"anybody know the apparatus needed for this experiment? i am trying to carry out an experiment on what kind of milk bacteria grows faster anybody knows what the apparatus needed are? Well, if you want to measure their growth in milk you need:\n\nPure culture of the bacteria in question, sterile milk, sterile glass tubes and a spectrophotometer.  This will measure the density of the bacteria in liquid culture.  I don't know what equipment you have access too (pipetts, tubes, a spectrophotometer etc).\n\nIf you've isolated the bacteria from milk and want to just measure their growth in ""whatever"", you can use any sterile growth medium that supports the growth of the isolated bacteria.  Again, measuring growth is most easily accomplished by use of a spectrophotometer.  \n\nGrowing bacteria on a plate to decide which grows faster is fairly insane, unless they have significant differences in growth.  I mean, are you going to stare at an agar plate for 24 hours just to see that at 14 hours 5 minutes a tiny pinpoint on plate A was visible, but it took 15 hours and 22 minutes for a colony of the same size on plate B?  No, of course you're not, it's not even plausible.\n\nWith liquid culture, you can take readings every hour for 8 hours and at 24 hours or something.\n\nYou can also dilute and spread-plate the bacteria from liquid cultures onto agar plates if you have your heart set on using them and achieving an exact count for bacterial populations.  But use of a spec still allows for comparisons between species, even without an exact population number.",science_mathematics

"What is magnetic moment?  Moment means rotating effect.\n\nWhen a door is opened or closed, it will be easy if we apply the force away from the hinge than when applying it near the hinge. Thus the rotating effect (moment) depends on the force and also on the distance between the hinge and the point of application of force.\n\nWhen two parallel equal forces opposite to each other are applied on a body it will rotate. The rotating effect (moment) is measured by any one of the forces and the distance between the forces. \n\nWhen a magnet is placed in a uniform magnetic field, two parallel forces will act on the two poles of the magnet and will rotate it. The moment (rotating effect) is the maximum when the axis of the magnet is perpendicular to the field and will be zero when the axis is in line with the external field.  The maximum moment of the magnet is magnetic moment of that magnet.\n\nIt is measured by the product of the magnetic pole strength and the distance between the poles (length of the magnet).",science_mathematics

Generally, non-euclidean geometries are geometries that use a different fourth postulate, that, in Euclidean geometry, says that corresponding angles of a transversed parrallel lines are equal.  This basically means that parrallel lines never meet.  There are two other possible postulates.  One is that parrallel lines do meet, i.e. that space is like a globe where longitudinal lines meet at the poles.  The other is that other lines, besides parallel lines don't meet. In this situation space is shaped like a saddle, and lines get farther and farther apart.  Those are the two I know.  There are three other Euclidean postulates (e.g. you can draw exactly one circle through a point in the center and one on the rim) that someone might be able to change, but I am not aware that anyone has done that.",science_mathematics

"what is time switching and how it relates to TDM?  TDM, or time division multiplexing is a scheme to encode several analog signals through one communications channel.\n\nLet's say that you have three telephone conversations.  An encoder, known as a multiplexer, will combine the three by switching very rapidly through all three conversations.  This is called multiplexing.  \n\nLet's say that the multiplexing speed is 66kHz, which translates roughly to 15 microseconds to complete one multiplex cycle (one divided by 66kHz).  The first 5 microseconds, conversation 1 is switched onto the line, the second 5us, conversation 2 is switched onto the line, and the third 5us conversation 3 is switched onto the line.  The cycle then repeats itself over and over.\n\nIf you listened to the communications line, it would sound like you were listening to three conversations simultaneously, like they were blended together.\n\nNow, on the other end of the communications line, a decoder, called a demultiplexer sorts out the three conversations with a precise clock and a time base signal that is added in at the multiplexing process.  So it sorts out the three conversations and seperates them into the three original channels by doing the switching in the exact opposite of the multplexer by again making the switch every 5us.   \n\nVoila, time switching combines three phone conversations over one set of wires.\n\nIn cellular phones, there is a scheme known as TDMA, or time division, multiple access.  This is similar concept, but it coordinates multiple cell phone's transmitters to accomplish the same thing, but over radio instead of wires.",science_mathematics

"What is the reason why the moon is not full every night? what eclipse the moon?  You know that when it's daytime for you, someone on the other side of Earth is experiencing night time - the Sun lights up half of the earth at any given time.  The same is true for the Moon - it is always half lit up by the Sun and half dark.  But we don't always see the lit up side.  Sometimes we do, like tonight (a Full Moon).  But other times we ""see"" the dark half (a New Moon) (you can't really see the dark half because it's dark!), and sometimes we see a little bit of both (First Quarter Moon, for example).  \n\nWe see different parts of the lit up side and the dark side because the Moon orbits Earth about once every month.  Right now, if you were to see the Sun, Earth, and Moon from high above Earth's north pole, the three would be almost lined up: Sun, then Earth, then Moon.  If they were *perfectly* lined up then there would be a lunar eclipse, but that only happens a couple times a year, if that.  Next week, as the Moon goes around Earth, the Sun, Earth, and Moon will make a right angle and not a straight line.  That's when we see a Third Quarter Moon - only the left half of the Moon will be visible as seen from Earth.  Another week and the Moon will be almost between the Sun and Earth, so the dark side of the Moon will be facing Earth - what we call New Moon.

The genetic code can still give variation with hemaphrodite reproduction which most (but not all) plants use Most animals (but not all eg snails, use sparate sexes) Would it be great if we were all hemaphrodite, no gays, no sexual discrimination! Two potentially unresolved questions in evolutionary biology are how and why did sex evolve (the big unresolved issue), and why only two as opposed to more sexes is stable. theory allegedly predicts three is more stable and better than two for example.\n\nYour text book anwsers, like recombination to break the linkage between ""good"" and ""bad"" genes and to avoid parasites (red queen hypothesis) explain why sex, ONCE it has evolved, is stable and selected for, BUT not how or why it evolved.\n\nPerhaps you should consider work by Lynn Marguilas et al. on the symbiont theory. Although now largely accepted that organelles like the mitochondria and chloroplast are degenearte symbionts, and less accepted that the nucleus is too, extrapolation of this theory would allow (account for) for the evolution of diploidy and reductive meisois (and thus sexual reproduction) by having two organisms (one aerobic the other anerobic) merging and seperating according to the oxygen levels (oxygen was at first a highly toxic compound to life untill aerobic metabolism evolved). \n\nBy the way hemaphrodites are still sexual, even selfing ones.\n\nAnd additionaly please note and remember for future that sexual discrimination, like homosexual discrimination, and so on, is neither a prerequisite nor a product of sexual reproduction.",science_mathematics

You can buy it at some gas stations, although it isn't common. The ratio of biodiesel to regular diesel varies depending on the vehicle and the season (less biodiesel in the winter, for example). \n\nThe benefits of biodiesel include lessening our dependence on foreign oil, increasing our use of renewable resources, especially those that are produced in our own country, and cleaner fuel both in use and in production. \n\nThe US government's standards for regular diesel are not as stringent as they are in other countries, although that will change in the next year or so. Right now, there are few American automakers who produce diesel passenger vehicles. You'll find diesel trucks, but I don't think there are any American made cars. This may change as the quality of diesel improves and as biodiesel becomes more readily available.\n\nBiodiesel is fairly easy to make.

"Is space ""something"" or is space ""nothing""? and why is that? As my education impressed on my mind; there is no empty space.

The law of ""convservation of energy"" is really something that holds on average.  Another principle called the uncertainty principle states that we cannot measure simultaneously the energy and time of a (system of particles?) more accurate than a constantant called h or hbar (a very small but finite number). \n\nSo in theory the universe can ""borrow"" energy from nowhere as long as that energy is returned before the h bar uncertainty in time runs out.  And thus ""empty"" space is filled with these vacuum fluctuations and is not really empty after all.  Of course I don't think I explained that too well.

"Beverage engineering? The pull tab was a major advance in the engineering desigan of beverage containers.  The tab pivots on a central bolt in the can's top. When you pull upward on one end of the tab, the other end presses downward on a portion of the can's top that has been scored. If you pull upward with a 10N force, approximately what is the magnitude of the force applied to the scored section? Its the ratio of the lengths.\n\nIts balance of angular momentum, so the length from the hinge and the forces exerted must be equal.\n\n10 N exerted upward at  2 cm from the fulcrum means that the downward load 2mm the other direction from the fulcrum is associated with a load of 100 N.\n\nYou may not have noticed, but there are special force concentrating deformations in the surface near where the tab presses.

"Protein Synthesis? What is protein synthesis? From Gene to Protein\nScientists that worked on Protein Synthesis:\n1. Archibald Garrod: First proposed the relationship between genes and proteins.\n2. George Beadle and Edward Tatum: working with Neurospora , formulated the one-gene-one-protein hypothesis. This was later changed to one-gene-one-polypeptide. Since some proteins are produced from more than one gene.\n\nThe Problem: Since there are 20 different amino acids; and these amino acids are used to make proteins, how does the information get from the DNA to the final protein product? In a DNA molecule the only variable part is the 4 different bases. How can 4 bases, or combinations there of , code for the 20 different amino acids?\n\n1. If 1 base coded for 1 amino acid = 41 (4) amino acids coded for.\n\n2. If 2 bases coded for 1 amino acid = 42 (16) amino acids coded for.\n\n3. If 3 bases coded for 1 amino acid = 43 ( 64) amino acids coded for.\n\nNotice the large gap between 2 and 3. It was concluded that each coding part of DNA (codon) consisted of 3 bases. Since 64 is larger than the 20 amino acids, it stands to reason that some amino acids are coded for by different codons. Why is this important?\n\nTranscription: DNA is too large to leave the nucleus. If the program it contains must leave the nucleus, an intermediate must be produced. This intermediate is called m-RNA. m-RNA is formed in the following way, RNA polymerase binds to, a region of the DNA called, the promoter. Here is found the start codon TAC which codes for the amino acid methionine. Once this has been established the m-RNA sequence is produced growing from the 5' - 3' region. This occurs at the rate of 60 nucleotides / sec. The terminator sequence will keep the process from going on indefinitely. The eukaryotic m-RNA must be modified before going to the ribosome, while the prokaryotic does not.\n\nTranslation: t-RNA : a specialized form of RNA used to carry a specific amino acid to the ribosome and place it in the proper position. t-RNA contains 80 nucleotides in the form of a clover leaf. The t-RNA must attach the correct amino acid to itself. The process is as follows:\n\n1. The specific amino acid reacts with a specific enzyme and ATP to release 2 P and combine the AMP and the amino acid.\n\n2. The t-RNA will replace the AMP and bond with the amino acid.\n\nRibosomes: Before translation ribosomes consist of 2 separate sub-units. As translation proceeds the ribosome parts come together to allow protein synthesis to begin.\n\nThere are 3 steps to protein synthesis:\n\n1. Initiation: m-RNA binds to the small subunit of the ribosome. There is 1 binding site for the m-RNA, and 2 binding sites for the t-RNA. The P site holds for the t-RNA carrying the growing polypeptide and the A site for the t-RNA carrying the next amino acid. AUG ( start codon ) is in place and the appropriate t-RNA delivers the amino acid Methionine. The large sub unit then joins and creates a functional ribosome.\n\n2. Elongation: The chain moves from the 5' - 3' direction caused by the use of GTP and several protein-enzyme complexes. As the polypeptide chain is produced the t-RNA move from site A to site P, and then are released into the cytoplasm. The polypeptide chain continues to grow, and is held to the ribosome by the t-RNA at the P site.\n\n3. Termination: The termination codons: UAA,UAG, and UGA stop the process by adding water to the end of the chain instead of an amino acid. In order for the protein to become functional, it must be folded into its appropriate shape,and/ or have some amino acids removed, and/or have some of the polypeptides modified by adding sugars or phosphate groups to them.\n\nThe Wobble Phenomenon: There are only 40 different types of t-RNA and 64 codons. This means that some of the t-RNA can pair up with several different codons. This can occur because the third base of a t-RNA molecule can form a hydrogen bond with more than one kind of base. U in the third position can bond with A ",science_mathematics
"Evolution? So, if evolution is true, why don't we find thousands of ""in-between-stages"" of evolving animals, and why is there NO EVIDENCE WHATSOEVER of MACRO-evolution. im talking evidence, not a lesson in faith. If you are talking ""in between"", what are you comparing it to?  'between' what and what?\n\nEvery living organism is 'in between' what its ancestors were like and what its descendants will become.\n\nIf you look through the fossil record, there are many many thousands of transitional fossils that show gradual changes in physical characters, often 'in between' one form and another.\n\nIn terms of human evolution, starting with a chimpanzee-like ancestor and ending with modern Homo sapiens sapiens, there is Australopithecus afarensis that shows adaptations for a bipedal stance - downward directed acetabula in the pelvis, broadened attachment for enlarged gluteal muscles, and greater ossification of the patella.  There is also some reduction of prognathism in the face which is related to balance issues as A. afarensis began standing upright.  All of these features are 'in between' those of chimps and the descendants, such as Australopithecus africanus which develops many of the adaptations of A. afarensis slightly farther, including even more bipedal stance, and the beginning of expansion of the brain cavity.\n\nOnce you get into the genus Homo, such as Homo habilis, there are further 'in between' forms.  The trend in general is towards enlarged braincase, and smaller face.  Homo erectus is 'in between' H. habilis and early Homo sapiens.  Early Homo sapiens is in between H. erectus and modern man (Homo sapiens sapiens) etc.\n\nFrom the earliest chordate, Pikaia, through the earliest jawless fish, through the development of jawed fish, to the evolution of bony fish, to the development of muscular lobed fins in the Sarcopterygii, to the development of lungs in the Rhipidistians, to the modification of limbs into legs in the amphibians, to the development of shelled eggs and terrestrial life in the early reptiles, to the changes in skull fenestration and jaw anatomy in the Synapsids, to the modification of keratinous scales into keratinous hair, to the development of a single boned jaw and sensitive, three-boned inner ear in the early mammals, through Morganucodon and the earliest Monotremes, and the adaptation of a diphyodont, heterodont specialized dentition, and modification of sebacious glands to provide fat-rich nourishment to young mammals, to the adaptation of bearing live young, and the nourishment of developing young through a placenta, and slow, gradual expansion of the brain case throughout the primate lineage, the increase in manual dexterity and the loss of a tail in the ape lineage, there are transitional forms for every single one of these steps, and many many many more.\n\nOr can you actually come up with any kind of SCIENTIFIC reason to reject this evidence?",science_mathematics

"Is Jurassic Park a possibility?  There are numerous difficulties with the Jurassic Park scenario.\n\n1.  We do not have any way to get a complete set of dinosaur DNA.  The movie/book addressed this by mixing in DNA from other species.  They picked an obscure species of African frog so they could have a forced plot point later.  (Dumb, Mr. Chrichton, dumb, especially when you could have used parthenogenesis to have the same plot twist!)  This doesn't really work, though.  You could mix in other things, and you might get something close to a dinosaur, but more than likely you wouldn't.\n\nGetting dinosaur DNA at all is rare.  Insects fossilized in amber do not have a good supply of functional Dino DNA despite the film/book.  Blood drinkers digest their food very quickly, while being covered in amber takes a while.  They've digested your sample!  Even if they somehow didn't, the bacteria inside them will corrupt the samples.\n\nBut, suppose, despite all this, you found some intact blood in an insect trapped in amber.  Okay, what is it?  Blood drinkers aren't very picky about where they get blood.  Is your sample a T. rex?  Diplodocus?  More than likely it isn't from a dinosaur at all, they did not have the world all to themselves!  And you can't really tell without sequencing the DNA, which destroys it, oops!  Can't clone that!  Wouldn't work anyway, we have no T. rex DNA  to compare it too!  Okay, so the only way to see what we've got is to actually clone it.  But we can't, because...\n\n2.  No mother.  Organisms do not come to term on their own.  Even egg laying species need to have the proper envirionment for the embryo during egg development.  Without close dinosaur relevatives, we have nothing to create the eggs nor anything to study the egg development to make them ourselves.  But, by point #1 above, we don't know what our sample is unless we sequence it, and that would destroy it!  If we sequenced it, we could tell if it was a mammal or a reptile or what, but that's not a specific enough mother.

"How do you solve these two problems? related to chemistry? 10 pts. Will be given out ASAP!? 1. How many grams of benzonic acid (C7H6O2) must be dissolved in 78.1 g of ethanol to raise the boiling point by 4.00 C degrees? Kb for the ethanol is 1.20 C/m.\n\n2. How many grams of pyrazole (C3H4N2) must be added to 451 g of benzene to lower the freezing point by 5.00 C? Kf for benzene is 5.12 C/m. These are the two equations you need to use.\nBP Elevation: Delta T = i(Kb)m\nFP Depression: Delta T = i(Kf)m\n\nThe Molarity should be the moles of solute over L of solution.  Given room temperature the Density of ethanol is 0.789g/ml and the Density of benzene is .8786g/ml.\n\nOnce the L of the solvent are found, you can use the data given and the equations above to figure out the moles dissolved in each question.  Then convert the moles found to each of solute's mass using Molar masses of each solute.  \n\nNote that van 't Hoff factor is considered 1 (and omitted) in the calculations, since neither ethanol or pyrazole ionizes extensively.\n\nPROBLEM 1:\n\nSince: BP elevation = Delta T = i(Kb)m\n     : Density of Ethanol = 0.789g/ml\n\n78.1g(1ml/.0.789g)(1L/1000ml)= 0.5133L of ethanol.\n\n4.00 = [1.20(x)]/98.98\nx= 0.3299mol benzonic acid   \nMolar Mass benzonic acid = 122.12g/mol\n\nTherefore 0.3299mol(122.12g/mol) = 40.27g of Benzoic Acid must be added.\n\n\nPROBLEM 2:\n\nSince: FP Depression = Delta T = i(Kf)m\n     : Density of benzene = 8786g/ml\n451g(1ml/.8786g)(1L/1000ml)= 0.5133L of benzene.\n\n5.00 = [5.12(x)]/0.5133L\nx= 0.501mol pyrazole   \nMolar Mass pyrazole = 68.07g/mol\n\nTherefore 0.501mol(68.07g/mol) = 34.10g pyrazole must be added.",science_mathematics

Why SUN appears red in dawn?  Why SUN appears red in dawn? (and dusk)\n\nThis is the time when the sun's light travels through most atmosphere to reach us. The small particles of dust scatter some of the light and most of the light scattered is blue light. As the blue light gets scattered out of the original white light the light that reaches us has a bredominance of red light and so the sun appears red.\n\nThis also explains why the sky appears blue during the day as we see much of this scattered light coming at us from all directions. It also explains why when we see the sun through smoke it appears very red as well and why we see great sunsets after days with a great deal of haze or after some event such as a huge volcanic eruption somewhere on the earth gives us a long sequence of beautiful sunsets (and sunrises) as the eruption of Mt Pinatubo in the Philipines did in the 1980s,science_mathematics

How can electricity make a battery powered proppeller spin. Short answer:  Electricity and magnetism are two sides of the same coin; each can cause the other.  For instance, moving a wire through a magnetic field can create a current, while current flowing through a wire also creates a magnetic field.  Thus, one can generate electricty by using some kinetic energy source--water, wind, what have you--move powerful magnets through wire coils.  There are other ways, of course.",science_mathematics

"how much light is 1,000,000 Candle Light Power? an ad says the emergency lamp posted  will provide 1,000,000 candle light power. what exactly does it mean and how bright would that be in day-to-day working condition? The ad is little misleading. It is true that light sources are evaluated and quantified in terms of candles, but there are two different terms and they mean different things. The first term is ""candela"" which can also be referred to as ""candlepower"" and it refers to the amount of light given out by a source IN ONE PARTICULAR DIRECTION actually decribed at one angle. So to know how bright your source was in candlepower, you would have to know something about its beamspread. But- making a bunch of assumptions here- IF the light was more or less shaped as a floodlight (all the light being emitted in one direction like a wide spot), and if it had 1,000,000 candlepower at 0°, then your light could give out roughly 150 times as much light as a 100-watt incandescent yard light like you'd get at Home Depot.\nSecond term: Lumen. A lumen is the term for the amount of light coming out of the source in ANY direction. The lumen is also tied the the candle so there's a relationship between the candela and the lumen. But the thing to remember is that it's non-directional. Knowing how many lumens a source has doesn't help you to know what it does because it could be very intense like a spotlight or very diffuse like an ordinary light bulb - both can give out the same amount of total light.\nSo if your emergency light has 1,000,000 lumens, then it would have 100 times as much light as a 500-watt incandescent, or 300 times as much as a standard fluorescent tube, or 40 times as much as a tall streetlight.\nNow- I have to say that both of these numbers are really really really high.

"why is the sky blue?  Here is something interesting to think about: When you look at the sky at night, it is black, with the stars and the moon forming points of light on that black background. So why is it that, during the day, the sky does not remain black with the sun acting as another point of light? Why does the daytime sky turn a bright blue and the stars disappear? \n\nThe first thing to recognize is that the sun is an extremely bright source of light -- much brighter than the moon. The second thing to recognize is that the atoms of nitrogen and oxygen in the atmosphere have an effect on the sunlight that passes through them. \n\nThere is a physical phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering that causes light to scatter when it passes through particles that have a diameter one-tenth that of the wavelength (color) of the light. Sunlight is made up of all different colors of light, but because of the elements in the atmosphere the color blue is scattered much more efficiently than the other colors. \n\nSo when you look at the sky on a clear day, you can see the sun as a bright disk. The blueness you see everywhere else is all of the atoms in the atmosphere scattering blue light toward you. (Because red light, yellow light, green light and the other colors aren't scattered nearly as well, you see the sky as blue.)",science_mathematics

A soft white lustrous transition metal, it has the highest electrical and thermal conductivity of any metal and occurs in minerals and in free form. This metal is used in coins, jewelry, tableware, photography, and in mirrors.\nSilver is a very ductile and malleable (slightly harder than gold) univalent coinage metal with a brilliant white metallic luster that can take a high degree of polish. It has the highest electrical conductivity of all metals, even higher than copper, but its greater cost and tarnishability has prevented it from being widely used in place of copper for electrical purposes.\n\nPure silver also has the highest thermal conductivity, whitest color, the highest optical reflectivity (although it is a poor reflector of ultraviolet light), and the lowest contact resistance of any metal. Silver halides are photosensitive and are remarkable for the effect of light upon them. This metal is stable in pure air and water, but does tarnish when it is exposed to ozone, hydrogen sulfide, or air containing sulfur.

"Great White Shark or Giant Alligator? Has anyone witnessed an attack between a Great White shark and a giant aligator?  Which one would win? By giant alligator, I think you are probably thinking of the Saltwater Crocodile (Crocodylus porosus) which inhabits northern Australia and is throughout the southeast Asian islands up to Bangladesh and India.\n\nThese crocs have been seen out at sea, and they are sometimes found with barnacles on them.  They would definitely have been found in waters that are also frequented by Great White Sharks (Carcharodon carcharias).\n\nThe saltwater croc is the largest living species of reptile, up to 6 or 7 meters long, and up to a ton in mass.  These big monsters tend to be set up in good territories inland though, it's the smaller and subordinate crocs that get pushed to out to sea in search of new territory.\n\nThe biggest Great Whites are also up to 6 or 7 meters in length, so it's a pretty close match as far as size.  Therefore, it's actually pretty unlikely that there would be a conflict.  \n\nMost predators won't fight without a reason.  There's too much as stake if they get injured to just attack things at random.  Unless one of the critters triggers the prey -> attack response in the other, they'd probably only fight to defend their territory.  Great Whites are pretty nomadic, and wouldn't have a territory, and the saltwater croc would be swimming between islands searching for his own territory, not interested in fighting sharks.\n\nAs far as prey responses, Great Whites favourite food is seals and sea lions.  One theory as to why humans are occasionally attacked is a superficial resemblance to a pinneped, especially if there's a surfboard involved.  The swimming pattern and body shape of a crocodile is nothing like the sea lion's, and it is very unlikely that a shark would mistake a croc for an easy meal.\n\nCrocodiles tend to sit in one spot, usually in murky water, and wait for prey to come close enough to trigger an attack response.  Mudcrabs, turtles, goannas, snakes, wading birds and fish are their most common prey, but they have been known to take buffalo, cattle, sheep, wild boar, monkeys and even humans.  A small, juvenile shark would likely be snapped up, but a full grown adult would probably be cruising deeper water and at faster speeds than something that a croc would attack.\n\nIf they did fight, both of them have immensely powerful jaws.  The crocodile is also covered in bony scutes that create almost a suit of armour over its body, especially its back.  The shark would probably lose many teeth trying to take a bite.  Both critters are remarkably tough too, being able to take a lot of damage and keep fighting, even if they are mortally wounded.  Should such an encounter occur, I would imagine that both animals would cause grievous, even mortal wounds to each other before breaking off the fight, and then they'd each end up dying of the wounds.\n\nEven cooler than a fight between a saltwater croc and a great white would have been a fight between a Deinosuchus (a huge late Cretaceous crocodylian possibly up to 50 feet long) and Carcharocles megalodon (a huge Eocene shark, possibly up to 50 feet long).

"Is travel faster than speed of light possible? If so, explain. If not, explain.?  It isn't possible speed wise, the closer you get to the speed of light, the larger your mass, until it becomes infinitely large - there is not enough power in the universe to acellerate you that fast.  The only way to travel faster than light is to take a shortcut, find a way from point a to point b that doesn't involve a direct course - like a wormhole or some other type of spacial rupture. If you think of 3D space as a sheet of paper, light can only travel over the surface - if you fold the paper, you get to the other side quicker by going right through the paper. Technically, you dont go as fast as light (which would have to travel the length of the 'paper'), but you get to your destination before light going the normal space-path would, so in that respect you do go faster than light.",science_mathematics

"does a dragon fly sting or bite you?  A dragonfly is any insect belonging to the order Odonata, the suborder Epiprocta or, in the strict sense, the infraorder Anisoptera. It is characterized by large multifaceted eyes, two pairs of strong transparent wings, and an elongated body.\nDragonflies typically eat mosquitoes, midges and other small insects like flies, bees, and butterflies. They are usually found around lakes, ponds, streams, and wetlands because their larvae, known as ""nymphs"", are aquatic. Dragonflies do not bite or sting humans; in fact, they are valued as a predator that helps control the populations of harmful insects, such as mosquitoes.",science_mathematics
"a solid brass statue weighs 190 N in air. what is its volume? the statue is suspended from a rope and totally immersed in water. what is the tension in the rope (the apparent weight of the statue in water)? Use Archimedes Principal to answer this question:\n\n""The buoyant force is equal to the weight of the displaced fluid.""\n\nThus, in air, the net force is equal to the statue's true weight minus the buoyant force.\n\n190 N = W - Fb\n\nThe statue's weight, W, is simply the density of the brass times its volume times gravity, and the buoyant force is equal to the density of the air times the statue's volume times gravity:\n\n190 N = d-brass * g * V - d-air * g * V\n\nRe-writing this expression provides the volume:\n\nV = 190 N / (d-brass * g - d-air * g)\n\nFrom Google, I found that the following typical densities (air is assumed to be taken at sea-level):\n\nd-brass = 8400 kg/m^3\nd-air = 1.2255 kg/m^3\nd-water = 1000 kg/m^3\n\nSubstituting these values provides:\n\nV = 190 N / (8400 * 9.8 - 1.2255 * 9.8)\n\nV = .00231 m^3\n\nWhen the statue is submerged in water, we again use Archimedes Principal to find its apparent weight:\n\nW = d-brass * g * V - d-water * g * V\n\nW = (.0231)*(9.8)(8400 - 1000)\n\nW = 167.4 N\n\nGood Luck :)",science_mathematics

"How is solar energy beneficial to humans?  Solar energy is a success story. It already supplies electricity to several hundred thousand people around the world, provides employment for over ten thousand and generates business worth more than $1 billion dollars. In the future, the pace of change and progress could be even more rapid as the solar industry unlocks its hidden promise.\n\nThe benefits of solar power are compelling: environmental protection, economic growth, job creation, diversity of fuel supply and rapid deployment, as well as the global potential for technology transfer and innovation.\n\nThe underlying advantage of solar energy is that the fuel is free, abundant and inexhaustible. The total amount of energy irradiated from the sun to the earth’s surface is enough to provide more than 10,000 times the annual global energy consumption. Yet these benefits remain largely untapped; most energy decisions taken today overlook solar power as a modular technology which can be rapidly deployed to generate electricity close to the point of consumption. Phasing in solar photovoltaics therefore requires a shift from centralised to decentralised power production, offering far greater control to individual consumers.",science_mathematics

"Lenz's Law Demonstration - Magnetic Physicists Needed? When a magnet is dropped down a long coil no e.m.f is induced in the middle section as (to my understanding)although flux linkage is at the maximum there is no change in flux linkage so Faraday's Law gives an e.m.f of 0. however in the classic demonstration of a magnet being dropped down a copper pipe there is clearly and e.m.f being induced all the way down the pipe to opppose the motion so that it reaches a terminal velocity and takes longer than expected to come out of the other end of the pipe. Can anyone explain the difference in the coil to the pipe that causes the effect in the pipe but not the coil. Thanks. The difference is that the pipe allows for complete current loops around the circumference of the pipe, which will generate a magnetic field in opposition to the falling magnet.  In a coil, with the ends disconnected, you won't have this happening.  You induce some emf in the coil, but it's not a closed circuit, or at least not one that can generate a magnetic field opposing the falling magnet.  You could consider small current loops induced within the wire, or around the circumference of the wire, depending on the magnet's orientation, but these will be small and weak compared to a current loop all the way around a pipe.  However, if you wire one end of the coil to the other,  you should get some Lenz's law braking of the magnet.   \n\nIt's a very clever idea for a demonstration.  I had to go set it up and test it myself with some magnet wire wound around a glass tube and a glass tube sheathed in a copper pipe, to see the effect you described.  Like I said, if you connect the coil to itself, you will see some effect, but it's not nearly as strong as the copper tube.  I think this is because the emf is induced in the coil as a whole, and not as a local loop as in the pipe, so you have a field of the same total strength, but it's not as strong locally. I think I'm going to have to play around with this some more and maybe do some actual math to figure out the full details.",science_mathematics

If it doesn't work after about a minute, start going back in the other direction.

"Are gamma delta T cells involved in T cell activation?  Although gamma delta T cell receptor-bearing lymphocytes (gamma delta T cells) constitute a significant minority of circulating and tissue-associated T lymphocytes, the mechanism responsible for the activation of these cells is unknown. To address this question, resting gamma delta TCR+, CD3+, CD4-, CD8- cells isolated from the blood of healthy volunteers were cultured with allogeneic dendritic cells (DC) or monocytes, and their proliferative response measured. DC alone induced gamma delta T cells to proliferate, with a peak response on the sixth day of culture. Pretreatment of DC with an anti-HLA-DR mAb, but not anti-HLA class I or anti-CD1 mAbs, inhibited the response of gamma delta T cells. Antibodies to gamma delta T cell receptor, CD2, CD3, or CD11a were also inhibitory, whereas antibodies to alpha beta T cell receptor, CD4, CD5, and CD8 had no effect. Although only 40-60% of freshly isolated gamma delta T cells expressed CD28, mAbs directed against CD28 or its ligand, CD80, were markedly inhibitory. Moreover, removal of CD28+ cells from the gamma delta T cell population nearly abrogated the response to DC. These results demonstrate that resting gamma delta T cells recognize and respond to MHC class II determinants on allogeneic DC in a manner that is highly dependent on the CD28 activation pathway as well as molecules such as CD2 and CD11a that mediate cell-to-cell adhesion.",science_mathematics

If your referring to a black-out style outage where the issue was with a transformer, then there is no equation it is simply a outage where a piece of equipment called a transformer failed.  A transormer is simply a container with 2 coils of wire used to change or transform voltage from one level to another. If you have a power pole in your back yard , if you look at the top there is usually 1 or more ""cannisters"" with wires running from the power pole to the cannister to your house. That cannister is a transformer.  The power pole has anywhere from 2000-5000 volts on it and the transformer's job is to lower the voltage level down to either 240 VAC in europe and other countrys or 110 VAC here in the US.  This is called a step down transformer.  There are also others called step up transformers that raise the voltage from 110 up to levels as needed. \nNow, if that piece of equipment fails then no power can pass down the line and give you electricity in your house. If a large transformer that supplys power to the city fails,then that city (or portion of that city conected to that transformer) will receive no power until the transformer is fixed. \n\nFor a better explanation (or a clearer one ) read here:\nhttp://science.howstuffworks.com/power.htm",science_mathematics
"What is fractal dimension? How is it calculated? A common type of fractal dimension is the Hausdorff-Besicovich Dimension, but there are several different ways of computing fractal dimension.  \n\nRoughly, fractal dimension can be calculated by taking the limit of the quo-  \ntient of the log change in object size and the log change in measurement  \nscale, as the measurement scale approaches zero. The differences come in  \nwhat is exactly meant by ""object size"" and what is meant by ""measurement scale"" and how to get an average number out of many different parts of a  \ngeometrical object. Fractal dimensions quantify the static *geometry* of an object.  \n\nFor example, consider a straight line. Now blow up the line by a factor of two. The line is now twice as long as before. Log 2 / Log 2 = 1, corresponding to dimension 1. Consider a square. Now blow up the square by a factor of two. The square is now 4 times as large as before (i.e. 4 original squares can be placed on the original square). Log 4 / log 2 = 2, corresponding to dimension 2 for the square. Consider a snowflake curve formed by repeatedly replacing ___ with _/&#92;_, where each of the 4 new lines is 1/3 the length of the old line. Blowing up the snowflake curve by a factor of 3 results in a snowflake curve 4 times as large (one of the old snowflake curves can be placed on each of the 4 segments _/&#92;_).  \nLog 4 / log 3 = 1.261...

"Uniformitarianism vs. Catastrophism - please rectify? The idea of uniformitarianism says that as things are happening today so they have always happened... well if that's the case, at the current rate of erosion, the highest mountains would be under water in less than 12 million years... so how is it that paleontologists are still digging up bones that are ""40 million years old"" and they're still above ground? You are misunderstanding a few different concepts here.  That is a pretty good definition of uniformitarianism...but it's important to understand that mountains are also building as they are eroding. An example of this is the Himalaya; they are sill rising about 3 inches every decade.  Hardly any erosion takes place on the higher peaks - too cold/covered in snow and ice.\n\nAlso, mountains build up in some areas, some areas erode, and many areas (of land) remain little changed (that's where you get your (relatively) young bones.  Many areas of land are also deposition areas that add material on top of old material (that's why you dig up bones and fossils).\n\nCatastrophism is now viewed as a very legitimate factor.

"What is high cycle fatigue?  Fatigue is the failure mechanism of many materials whereby a variable stress causes a crack to grow in the material.  As the crack grows, the bulk of the material  can not carry the imposed load and the crack grows faster until the material suddenly fails.\n\nIn steels, low cycle fatigue is the general term for fewer than a few thousand stress cycles to failure (bend a paper clip a few times and it breaks, low cycle fatigue).  Above that is termed high cycle fatigue.  In steels, if the material deos not fail after about 2 million cycles, and the conditions remain the same (load, environment, etc) it won't fail.  The stress level is called the endurance limit.\n\nSome structural materials, such as aluminum alloys, don't show a clear endurance limit, they will eventually fail.  Think about that the next time you step on the airplane.",science_mathematics

"If time dilates as it approaches the speed of light, does a photon really move?  Photoms really move in that they can change position, but recall that they also function as waves.  Since they have no mass, there isn't a reliable way to tell where they've gone or how fast they're moving so time dilation is less of an issue, just like the increased mass effect.",science_mathematics
"Question regarding Quadratic Equation? 1: I found some parts to this equation: (x-3)^2 = 16\n\n Next 2: I wanted to see if my answer was right for square rooting both sides: x = 3-(square root of)16 or x = 3+(square root of)16 (both over 1)\n\n3: How do I solve this equation by factoring with the zero product rule - can someone write this out .. I think i messed up my steps .. for my answer .. I got: x = 3 or x = 3 .. I thinks that wrong because there should be a negative .. I did substitute them back in .. but I just want to be safe and confirmed\n\n4: Lastly .. when solving this by quadratic formula .. how can I put this equation into ax^2+bx+c=0 for .. so I can my a,b,c,b^2,4ac,2a\n\nI appreciate your help .. can someone provide me with the answers to all so I can go back and check my work.\n\nThanks 1. When you square root both sides you get x - 3 = +4 or - 4\nNow add 3 to bot sides and get x = 7 or -1\n\n3 and 4 are similar.  (x-3)^2 means (x-3)(x-3) which is x^2 - 6x + 9\n\nSo x^2 - 6x + 9 = 16\n\nSubtract 16 from both sides to get x^2 - 6x - 7 = 0\n\nTo use the zero product rule, factor by FOIL:(x-7)(x+1)=0\n\nAnd to use quadratic formula, you can see\n that a= 1, b= -6, and c= -7",science_mathematics
"Can someone explain metabolic acidosis? How does it affect blood pH, urine pH, and respiratory rate? medicine, metabolic acidosis is a state in which the blood pH is low (under 7.35) due to increased production of H+ by the body or the inability of the body to form bicarbonate (HCO3-) in the kidney. Its causes are diverse, and its consequences can be serious, including coma and death. Together with respiratory acidosis, it is one of the two general types of acidosis.",science_mathematics

"whats the reason for chloroquine resistance in plasmodium falciparum?  This is for your parasitology class, right.\nBasically, resistance to elimination by the plasmodium falciparum parasite is due to giving insufficient doses to the patient, thus helping the parasite build up a resistance to the chloroquine.\n\nThis is something to worry about with any parasite using any anti-parasitic.  \n\nAny person administering anti-parasitics to a patient must calculate the dosage correctly to avoid resistance to treatment.\n\nCorrect weight/%/dose calculation will guarantee the parasite will be erradicated successfully.\n\nInterestingly, we have the same problem with cockroaches in our dwelling places, what?",science_mathematics

"How do bessel functions relate to drums?  For circular membranes, the radial part of the vibrations is a bessell function while the angular part is an ordinary trigonometric function. This comes from writing the wave equation in polar coordinates and doing a separation of variables. The radial function turns out to satisfy Bessell's equation. The frequencies then turn out to correspond to the zeros of the bessell functions.",science_mathematics
