"What is the meaning of life?  to tell people this: I know that you can go to heaven if you get saved and the way that you get saved is if you believe that Jesus died on the cross from your sins, rose on the third day, and then you have to confess to God in prayer that you are a sinner and that you believe He died on the cross for your sins and ask for His forgiveness on your sins and it is THAT simple, salvation is a free gift, we can't earn it.

"This question is ONLY for Muslims...Please Read, I need help!!? Well, first off, I am a 23 yr old caucasian American girl who was born into Christianity. My whole entire life I have never felt a connection to Christianity and I have never been able to accept Jesus as my God. For the past 5 years now I have been researching Islam, reading the Qur'an and familiarizing myself with the Muslim religion. I feel that Islam is the religion for me, 100%. I, with all my heart, want to convert to Islam. However, I am afraid that I will not be accepted by Allah because of all the herendous sins I have commited in my considerably short life. Sins including drug use, being promiscuous, having a child out of wedlock, stealing and lying. I regret my sins so much that it makes me physically and mentally ill. I wish so much that I could be forgiven for my sins and live a pure life. So I guess what my questions are is, can I be a Muslim considering the horrible sins I have committed? Would a Muslim man be allowed to marry me? I am worthy of Islam? Please help me... I am going to be very blunt with you. Like it or not, your post made the hair on my arm stand on ends!\nThis is Hypocrisy at it is best.  You were born into a Christian family, lived you whole life as one, and yet you have lived your life as you pleased without any consideration to what you might do, and what might happen to you, and then you won't to convert to Islam, implying that your free life was caused by you being Christian not by what you have done.  Don't blame Christianity for your past life, and now you are looking for a way out!\n\nIf you truely regret your sinns, then you should confuse your sins to God and never do them again.  Not leave God, not abandon God, and pretend you are looking for the right path! you seem had never been on the right path.  And you are worried if a Muslim man will marry you! you better believe it, many will be happy to marry a convert to their faith.  After all, you have forsaken your religion for theirs.\n\nCan you be a Muslim? Yes you can. and don't forget that Muslims also sin, they are not far from sinning nor are they Angels, if that what you think.\nA Muslim man is allowed to marry you.  Don't put yourself down so much.  You sinned, so what, everyone sinned one time or another, some sinn more than other, but we all sin, inculding the Muslims, and those whom you think are worth more than you.  You sound as if you are begging for a Muslim man to marry you.  Look for a Good man, not just a muslim man. \n\nNow I am going to get it for this.  Islam is not worthy of you.  Help you!! God help those who help themselves.  If you ever been a christian then this blessing for you.  If you think Islam is 100% for you, then you should learn a little more of what you may go into.  \n\nIN the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy SPirit may you have peace in your heart, soul and spirit.  \nDon't forsaken your Lord who put his life on the line for you, and never forget his teaching.  Amen.\n\nADD:\nI regret posting this message to you, not because I don't believe in what I say, but because you will not hear my words.  I wish you well.  Muslims claim to say they believe in Jesus Christ, and at the same time, they don't give him the proper respect.  I know the muslims so well.  If you are really a christian! Islam is not for you, believe me.  But it is up to you.  Think hard, long and wise.  Finding a man to marry you, not so hard to do.  I say this to you with all respect.\n\nI like to ask you a question, if I may!\n\nThey tell you by converting to Islam that all your past sins will be forgiven?! Don't believe it.  the question.  How do he Muslims get their past sins forgiven!! do they convert to Christianity?  \nIn the time of the judgment day, Jesus Christ will be the one who will be judging you. Christians and Muslims believe he will return for the judgment day, not Muhammad, But Jesus Christ.  Ever wonder why it is Jesus and not Muhammad!  think about it, and you will know why.  Don't forget that.  \n\nTHINK HARD, LONG and be WISE.  and Good luck to you.\n\nWATCH THESE, AND IF YOU STILL THINK ISLAM IS GOOD FOR WOMEN, THEN GOOD LUCK TO YOU. AND MAY THE  LORD BE WITH YOU AND PROTECT YOU.\n\nYou study it for five yrs!

I truely wish I didn't post this message, but I started, and I must finish what I start, at least this post.  Good Luck to you.\n\nMay the Lord Keep",society_culture

Good Question!!!\n\nI can only guess at the individual's replies to this as you and I have already ""joined hands"" at this site and hope that others will also adhere to your request.\n\nThe reason we have not done so up until now of course is that such a site was not available and we, the creationists and the evolutionists (I am BOTH, being a CYBORG), were kept in isolation from one another by the religious leaders on one side and the ""scoffs"" of the intellectuals from Academia on the other.\n\nThe debate has been mostly in the hands of the ""experts"" as in all other societal disciplines.  Health was in the hands of the Medical professionals, Politics in the hands of the professional (used car dealers and  lawyers) politicians, and the environment in the hands of Industry and government bureaucrats.  It is no wonder we feel ""disempowered"".  We gave away all our power to ""experts"", we thought.  And now we feel ""disillusionned"" because they were and are no more ""experts"" than we were and are.\n\nWell now, we will, starting with you and me, join hands and ""make decisions"" on these important issues and change our minds and realities, one at a time.  It's an education process, but it has now begun.  Your ideas on the issues are just as important as the ""experts"" ideas on the issues.  \n\nWe now have to take this process to the next stage and take (not ask for), legally and politically binding votes on the ""issues"" in a ""DIRECT DEMOCRACY""....We will soon have it.  Those debates have also begun.  \n\nI would like to see a ""parallel election"" taking place on-line and see how many participate.  The vote would not be for ""people"" as our ""representatives"" but on the ""issues"".  We would still need representatives to see that the job gets done but those are called ""public servants"" and ""bureaucrats"".  The ""elected"" representative would become a ""PR"" man and not a ""decision-maker"".  The people would then decide in a ""true democracy"".  That is the ""vacuum"" that will suck all other societies into the ""Age of UNCERTAINTY"" and ""PROBABILITY"" that is the Quantuum REALITY.  We don't know where it will lead, but we have no other choice.   This is already being done in some countries such as ""switzerland"" and some states as in Washington, Oregon, California, and many more...And those socieities have not fallen apart but are the most ""stable"" and ""progressive"" communities on our planet.  Switzerland is the place for everyone to ""place"" their money and the States that have ""binding ""initiatives and referenda"" can outperform other countries that still use the much slower and inefficient ""representative democracy""...\n\nWith the ""theological"" questions, the experts get their info from an ""authority"" that is ""not present"" and only communicates with some of ""HIS"" (MALE), favourites or 'CHOSEN'...Those who are not PRESENT cannot VOTE!!!

Please advise, my Boss doesn't like it and I feel humilated, descriminated and embarrassed. Thank you. To be honest I have never heard of it being ""taboo"", it's considered not exactly good manners(especially if you don't excuse yourself) but people won't ostracize you from society or anything ridiculous like that. Your boss sounds like he has a problem to me.\nMy husband also suffers from heartburn and indigestion on occasion and he sucks on ""Quickeez"" lozenges, you can also get them in a chew from and they really help settle that nasty feeling down.

"Why do people beleive that ""they're fighting over there so they don't have to do it here (U.S.)""? It doesn't make sense.\n\nThe attacks on American soil have mainly been done by Americans.\n\n9/11 was simply the result of overseas provocation.\n\nAmericans being in Iraq killing, raping, and destroying is, if anything, increasing the chances of more attacks on U.S. soil.\n\nHow can anyone beleive otherwise?\n\nThe U.S. is being too cocky.  Other nations have learnt from war because they've seen the tragedies right infront of their faces.  Americans (not all of course) support war because they don't know the harsh realities.\n\nSo, I'm almost positive that there will be more attacks on U.S. soil.  Precisely because the U.S. is so militaristic now. I don't know how they can believe it, either.  People, like most creatures on this Earth, don't want trouble.  They don't attack unless provoked.

Well, we know that from nothing, nothing comes. So if there was ever a time when there was absolutely nothing in existence then nothing would have ever come to exist. But things do exist.

I am not sure why but I  think they believe thats how the prophet used to wear it.\n  Most muslims prefer to wear their trousers in a normal way with the end of the trouser NOT touching the earth but just above 1 cm from the floor.\n  Reason1: The floor is full of garbage and dirt and they dont want to dirty their clothes.

"evolution? or one creator?  Evidence for evolution:\n1. Vestigial structures.\n2. Microevolution can be observed in both a controlled laboratory setting and in nature.\n3. The fossil record.\n4. Imperfect structures (the blind spot of the mammalian eye, for example).\n5. Developmental biology reflects evolutionary lineage.\n6. Genetic analysis shows similarities among species reflecting evolutionary origins.\n7. Homologous structures.\n8. Many cellular and biochemcial processes are conserved in a variety of species.\n9. Vestigical biochemical pathways (for example, pancreatic cells are light-sensitive even though they are located deep inside the body).\n\nThose are just a few off the top of my head. If you'd like to know more about any of them, just ask.\n\nEvidence for intelligent design:\nUmm... the bible says so?\n\nI think the choice is clear. It's not a question of ""belief,"" but rather of rational thought, reasoning, and examination of evidence.\n\n\n_______________\nResponse to johnblessed01:\n\nFirst, I did not state that each of the points taken own its own is irrefutable proof of evolution.  I said that each of those constitutes evidence that evolution occurs.  While no one point proves evolution, taken in combination the body of scientific evidence that supports evolution is quite strong.\n\nNow to address the individual arguments:\n1. Vestigial structures.\n\nWhere did I saw that the human tail bone is the best example of a vestigial structure?  I'm not an expert on human anatomy, but I will not deny that the tail bone has a structural function in the human body.\n\nOne example of a vestigial structure in humans in the appendix.  It has no function.  Removing it is harmful only in so far as any surgery is associated with certain risks (so I wouldn't have it removed just for fun, but it's because of the surgery not the absence of the appendix).  An appendix is found in several mammals.  In humans it is small and has no known function.  In rabbits and many other herbivours it is large and is used in the digestion of cellulose.\n\nAnother example of a vestigial structure is the hip bones of snakes.  Snakes evolved from quadrupeds, and some species still retain not on pelvises, but tiny protrutions of bone in a location that corresponds to the location of the legs in other quadrupeds.\n\n\n2. Microevolution can be observed in both a controlled laboratory setting and in nature.\n\nI didn't say that microevolution proves macroevolution.  However, it does provide evidence that macroevolution may be possible.  On its own microevolution is not terribly compelling for the reasons johnblessed01 described.  However, taken in context of the other evidence for evolution, microevolution provides a mechanims by which macroevolution could occur.  On its own, it doesn't prove that macroevolution occurs, but it does suggest that it is possible.\n\n\n3. The fossil record.\n\njohnblessed01's response to this point demonstrated a lack of understanding of the processes involved in fossilization and the methods associated with reconstructing evolutionary history.  Obviously the ""geological column"" is a simplification.  Scientists can reconstruct a sequence of events based on the types of surrounding rocks (I'm not an expert in geology but a geologist could explain in great detail how different types of rocks form), carbond dating, and various other methods.\n\nGeologists can distinguish sedemntary layers formed rapidly by a volcano from layers formd by, for example, changing bodies of water and low-acting forces of nature.  But again, this is not the only method of dating fossiles.\n\nThe time scale under which fossilization takes place depends on the geological and environmental conditions.  These can be assessed based on the chemical composition of the fossile and the surrounding material, as well as other factors.  Petrification can occur extremely rapidly in, say, a bog or a tar pit, but not at the bottom of",society_culture

When you are immune to the opinions and actions of others, you won’t be the victim of needless suffering.\n\nDon’t Make Assumptions\nFind the courage to ask questions and to express what you really want.  Communicate with others as clearly as you can to avoid misunderstandings, sadness, and drama.  With just this one agreement, you can completely transform your life.\n\nAlways Do Your Best\nYour best is going to change from moment to moment; it will be different when you are healthy as opposed to sick.

Then that summer I went on vacation to Florida, and when I came back I realized how immature my friends are compared to me. I started to break away from them until eventually I figured that I really don't want to be friends with these people anymore. The problem is that they all live on my street within a few yards of me, and mostly, they just don't get it. It's like they can't grasp the concept that I'm leaving their little group.

How can I tell them nicely that I just want them to back off? That can be tricky, especially if you were good friends with any of them.\nThe best thing to do is to just be honest.  Tell them that you have changed, and your interests have changed, and you just do not feel that you have anything in common with them anymore.

"Can you be persecuted if you don't really exist? Several writers have suggested that Christianity was not formed until several hundred years after Christ.  This notion has absolutely no basis in fact whatsoever.  If you want secular sources alone, fine, take Roman historians (such as Tacitus).  Nero persecuted/killed hundreds of CHRISTIANS around 64 AD.  Domitian did the same at the close of the 1st century.  How did they persecute a group that didn't exist? To whom are you referring? Do you have any citations? Jesus' followers during his lifetime and shortly after are considered Christians, and Christianity started out as a Jewish sect. I don't think this is in dispute by reputable religious scholars, so some citations from you would be helpful to get to the bottom of this. \n\nA timeline for Christianity can be found below.\n\nETA: Anyone who thinks Christianity started in the Garden of Eden is completely wacko.

You're right that writing is indeed a powerful tool not just in sharing facts but on stirring other peoples minds and inject senseless claims that he himself can't prove.  \n\nThe book has strayed you from the facts after you are claiming that what he used are facts.  You gave me an impression that you believe Dan Brown's misrepresentation of the Church as a murderous institution and also that the Christian faith is utterly false.\n\nNow, you should know why the Vatican is against it.  Brown was deaf tone to the feelings of millions of Christians.  It is irresponsible and offensive for Brown to impugn the faith of countless Catholics in this fashion. He has no solid evidence to support these contentions, and in the absence of such evidence it is unacceptable to smear the faith of millions with these charges.\n\nA comparable smear would be saying that Lutherans have been murdering the descendants of Luther or that Jewish leaders have been murdering the descendants of Moses. If such charges were made, particularly with no evidence, they would be regarded instantly as vicious and bigoted slanders against what other people hold sacred.\n\nClaiming that Catholics have been killing the descendants of their God is a vile and unacceptable assault on their faith.

Having a black family in your neighborhood will not bring anyone's neighborhood value down.  Sadly enough, usually when a black family moves in, you will find out who the biggest bigot is first.  Because they will be the first to leave.  By you being 17 years old, you have a chance to educate yourself and not fall prey to ignorance.

God is the only one who can judge us. All these people talking about how good they are... I don't need that.  Also, I feel that we need to read between the lines of many things in the bible.  Ways change.  Just because it was like 2000+ years ago, doesn't mean that it has to be that way now.  Many things in the bible are the way they are for societal reasons. Not because God ""said so.""

"to every single christian with respect...only chritians plz? my questions are for every single christian out there...(1): is there any single christian who had memorize the whole of the bible word by word...? (2): is there any visual significance of the truth of your religion...? (3):why there are so many bibles or holly books why not a single  one  in a religion...? Christians know that they don't have to memorize the Holy Bible word for word, it should be interpreted and understood with the guidance of the Holy Spirit. Without that guidance, the interpretation can be as numerous as the stars in the sky and the understanding can be as wide as the universe. In other words, those who attempt to interpret it by himself without the help of the Holy Spirit can even create a different story which sometimes lead to the foundation of new christian churches. Hence, the protestants, Seventh day Adventists, the Baptists, the Mormons (Latter Day Saints) and more. Now, Born again Christians are becoming the trend. All point to the Catholic Church as a Doomsday Church. But if we try to observe, the Catholic church never ever tried to show resentment with all the negative propaganda against it. Instead, it always try to preach forgiveness and unity no matter how offensive the accusation it has faced since then.\n\nWhat actually opened the gate to the different Biblical versions is nothing more than the upholding of human freedom. Freedom is a very delicate but admittedly the best possession man can ever have. Absolute freedom is precious to those who understand the positve attributes of it but likewise can become a dangerous social factor to those who refuse to respect it and would otherwise abuse it instead. \n\nWith freedom at hand, human mind was freed from the bondage of the past. It gave him the power to think freely, speak freely, believe freely and to choose freely. It freed the human mind from fear, anger, disillusionment, mental suppression and instead encouraged it to be creative, intuitive, critical, argumentative, reasonable, resourceful and productive. Thus, it is easy to see now why people have created airplanes, ocean vessels, space shuttles etc. including the discovery of the different sect coming from the one Christian Church of Jesus Christ as the Head. Can you see now what freedom can do? But all are individually answerable to God no matter what he or she believes and practice in his or her lifetime because a religion can never save you, it can only guide you towards God but the choice will always be yours. \n\nI am a Roman Catholic and I believe I too has accountability towards God and whatever God decides for me at the end of time, I will wholeheartedly accept because I know I can never question Him and It is Him who alone can save me.",society_culture

"Do the Blind dream?  Yes, blind people do dream. What they see in their dreams depends on how much they could ever see. If someone has been totally blind since birth, they only have auditory dreams. If someone  has had a measure of sight, then that person dreams with that measure of sight. Those individuials who have had some sight before they went blind can dream as though they can see, colors included. \n\nIN all fairness, one should first look at what a dream is.. really.. this must be understood before the question could be fully answered. The word ""dream"" has four interrelated meanings that follow one from another. When we put them altogether, we know what a dream is. \n\nFirst, a ""dream"" is a form of thinking that occurs when (a) there is a certain, as yet undetermined, minimal level of brain activation, and (b) external stimuli are blocked from entry into the mind, and (c) the system we call the ""self system"" (the ""I,"" the ""me"") is shut down.\n\nSecond, a ""dream"" is something we ""experience"" because the thinking is very real and makes use of our senses -- especially seeing and hearing; because usually we are the main actor; and because a dream is sometimes very emotional (but not always). \n\nThird, a ""dream"" is what we remember in the morning, so it is ""a memory"" of the dreaming experience. \n\nFourth, a ""dream"" can also mean the spoken or written ""report"" we give to others about that experience, which is the only way anyone else can ever know about another person's dreams (because they can't be seen by others or told about by us while they are happening). \n\nSO....in summation (keeping in mind what dreams are),\n\nThere are no visual images in the dreams of those born without any ability to experience visual imagery in waking life. \n\nIndividuals who become blind before the age of five seldom experience visual imagery in their dreams, there has been  reports some visual imagery in six schoolchildren who lost their sight before age five. \n\nThose who become sightless between the ages of five and seven may or may not retain some visual imagery. \n\nMost people who lost their vision after age seven continue to experience at least some visual imagery, although its frequency and clarity often fade with time.",society_culture

Hi.\nNo offense,\nhow come on tv there is channels like\nBET,UNIV,Indian tv,and Lifetime,but when you have a channel like ""White tv"",it would raise racial issues and be considered ""racist"".I think its very hypocritical how you can have shows for Indians,and Mexicans and other races,but when you have a channel for whites people raise issues and say that the channel is racist when they are the ones trying to get rid of it.\nWhat do you think?\nThanks. i think you're right",society_culture
"music question for those who believe in god (and those who don't)? i was listening to my ipod today and i wondered, do those who beleive in god (i had christians in mind to be honest) care about what thier favorite musicians say in thier lyrics? if there is something religiously objectionable in some song, will you not listen to that band? or will you not listen to that one song?\n\nfor example, i like nine inch nails. there's a some called ""heresy"", and the lyrics go ""your god is dead, and no one cares, if there is a hell, i'll see you there"". many would find this objectionable, but would that prevent you from listening to this band if you liked other songs, or the music in general?\n\ni'm just curious. As a believer I stay open to different views.I don't go around saying that I won't watch this program or listen to that song because it says something against my faith.I know the truth of what I believe and so I have no problem listening to or watching something that may go against my faith.It's not going to change my faith and anyone who thinks it will change their faith or hurt their faith doesn't, in my view, have a very strong faith to begin with...\n\nI like Nine Inch Nails  :)",society_culture

In fact, I'll bet that 99% of them don't even know it's there. The Bible is vulgar, violent, and should be banned from the shelves to anyone under the age of 18. I won't be surprised if this message is deleted for its content. I do agree that there is a lot of disturbing, vulgar, and not very ""family values"" oriented stuff in the Bible. When I read the Bible it seems so obviously written by uncivilized men that I have a hard time understanding how some people still think it is the divinely inspired word of God.

"Describe utilitarianism as an ethical system which is good and powerful? Also give critizisms for which utilitarianism is weak and bad. It depends on which definition you employ: 1. worth or value is determined solely by utility; or, 2. that action is best which brings the greatest happiness to the greatest number.  #2 on the surface appears to be more humane than #1 although both are accepted definitions.

If you do something bad but it isn't a law, then I think people would count it as ""breaking a law"" probably because I guess all the laws should ban you from doing bad stuff. Of course, you really aren't breaking a law since they didn't say you can't do that thing but people would probably say you did.\n\n(First detail question). If God didn't give any commandments, then we wouldn't really know how much we sin probably because God made the commandments so we would see how much we sin.

There's laws about not murdering and stealing but people are already stealing and murdering and breaking the laws. Think of it when there AREN'T any rules or laws.\n\n(Second detail question).

I'm really tired of this endless debate on how religion lead us to salvation and how jesus can lead me to heaven. I'm not an atheist but i fail to understand why you advocates of religion need to constantly convert others. Is this a reflection of insecurity or doubt? How blinded we are to think that all that exists in the cosmos can be explained in a couple of books. There are more things in heaven and earth than exists in your philosophy.\nDo you not agree that the time you spent 'saving' others may be better spent helping the poor or making an actual contribution? What is the purpose of religion? Is it a means for us to live more meanigful lives or is it just a way to 'classify' us and segregate us and to divert attention away from what untites us? Good question.\nReligions are only different ways to become closer to the creator. Some people need more commands and religious ceremonies to reach higher level of virtue and purification; others need only few commands to become purify and a good person.\nReligions should regarded as intermediary means , religions themselves are not the goal.\nreligions can educate people to live in  peace and harmony, to love people and control our ""natural vicious behavior""  and being virtuous.\nAll these can be  achieved only if we don't judge other people and don't try to convert them to any religion.

""Surely you are a bridegroom of blood to me,"" she said. 26 So the LORD let him alone.

The NIV, which you are quoting, is not very accurate, by the way - use a parallel Bible with several versions beside each other, and it'll help.\n\nMoses neglected to circumcise one of his sons because his wife (Zipporah) was opposed to it.

I think that most parent's concerns are that if they discipline their children then their children won't love them, or end up doing something worse than what they are already doing.  Then of course there is the threat of what our society condones as discipline as being taken for flat out abuse.\n\nWhat I have learned, and I have two that are very rebellious, 13 years apart, one is grown and one is hitting puberty, that using a system of Love and Logic works everytime on every kid.\n\nWhat this means is that you have to learn to separate yourself from your children's emotions.

This teaches them that they are fully responsible for their actions and will learn to think before they act or react.",society_culture

If you find it is true and can prove that such a detestable act has occurred among you, you must attack that town and completely destroy all its inhabitants, as well as all the livestock.  Then you must pile all the plunder in the middle of the street and burn it.  Put the entire town to the torch as a burnt offering to the LORD your God.  That town must remain a ruin forever; it may never be rebuilt.  Keep none of the plunder that has been set apart for destruction.  Then the LORD will turn from his fierce anger and be merciful to you.  He will have compassion on you and make you a great nation, just as he solemnly promised your ancestors.  ""The LORD your God will be merciful only if you obey him and keep all the commands I am giving you today, doing what is pleasing to him.""

But in this cases, it looks as if there are multiple light sources in moon, which is not possible.\n \nIssue 2:\nThe foreground of many images of the astronauts on the Moon are filled in with light, while the shadows remain absolutely black, again proving that there are multiple light sources.\n\nIssue 3 :\nThere are no stars in the background from pictures taken on the Moon.\n \nIssue 4 : \nIn some images, a huge light source can be seen reflected in the astronaut's visors. This has to be a very bright, nearby source. There  is no possibility of external light source in moon.\n \nISSUE 5 - How could NASA take TV images of the LM ascending on Apollo 15, 16, and 17 if there was no one on the Lunar surface to man the camera?\n \n\nISSUE 6 - There can't be any pictures taken on the Moon because the film would melt in the 250° temperatures. Any  film exposed to 250° would indeed melt at that temperature.\n\nIssue-7 :  The LM engine was very powerful. How come it did not leave a crater below the spacecraft? Why didn't it kick up any dust when it landed?\n\n \nissue 8: The footprints left by the astronauts are proof that the Moon landings are fake.\nThis one is also essentially a two pronged argument. First, the Fox show charged that the LM engine was so powerful that the upper layer of dust should have been blown away around the LM, so there should not be any footprints. Others have charged that the footprints should not be there since in the absence of water as a bonding agent, they should not maintain coherent shapes and sharp outlines.\n \n\n \nissue 9: There is no dust on LM footpads. -- According to Kaysing and Fox, this is the strongest evidence that the Moon landings are faked.

Your kidneys are involved in both BP regulation (through water+salt retention) and also RBC production (through erythropoetin secretion).  Damage to the kidneys and/or stenosis of the arteries could do this.  It is also possible that she has something called polycythemia vera which is a pathological overproduction of RBCs (are you by any chance, Jewish?).

There is nothing that goes against it or points to a different way to scientifically explain modern diversity. There is not one fossil or one piece of DNA that does NOT point to evolution. It would be hard NOT to see the concrete evidence, and only those blinded by faith can do this.\n\nEvolution is 100% world-wide accepted fact, including the evolution of man.\n\nThere is ZERO evidence for a higher being causing anything. This is why people who are religious need faith, you can't see or study the actions of a deity, by definition. Evolution has ZERO faith and ALL evidence.\n\nScientists (real ones) have been studying and supporting evolution for over 150 years, and still nothing has pointed to creationism. There is clear links and transitional forms between everything in the fossil record to the Class-Family level, if not Genus-Species level. And this includes humans, which there are several 'missing links' which are well described and studied, people just choose to ignore this. Sure, there are still things we don't know, but that's why science is not stagnent and dead. We learn more every day, that's what happens when you keep an open mind and follow the scientific method.\n\nThere are some areas of evolution in which all of the pieces have not been found in the fossil record, but there is no counter theory that has even ONE piece of evidence that can not easily be explained by evolution.\n\nLet me turn the question around, if Creationism was correct and science could definitively prove Creationism (and thus the existence of God), why would they not? That would be the greatest scientific discovery in the history of the world. No one would pass that up to maintain the 'status quo'. There is no conspiracy to hide creation evidence.

Objects are in motion but under the effects of gravity.\n\n#2) Gravity is a constant with a few rules to follow: the gravitational force between two objects is directly proportional to their mass but inversely proportional to their distance from each other. This means that object with more mass have more gravitational force but the gravity that they generate is lessened as two object move farther apart from each other.\n\nScientists speculate whether the universe will eventually succumb to the forces of gravity, causing all matter to eventually be pulled back into where the Big Bang originated, or if the Bang was sufficiently powerful, will all of the matter in the celestial bodies in the universe continue moving outward until the distance between the stars is so great that gravity can't overcome it and each galaxy is left to slowly burn out like sparks from a fireworks display?\n\nFor the last part of your question, people can walk on the Earth and on the Moon. The gravitational pull of our moon is a fraction of the Earth's pull because the moon is a fraction of the Earth's mass (remember the rules in part 1). We can't breathe on the moon because there isn't an atmosphere. The lack of an atmosphere has nothing to do with the moon's size though.

"Are some alkali metals more reactive than others? If yes, why? I mean in like certain amounts. for example: Is 1 gram of lithium as reactive as 1 gram of potassium in water? Reactivity of Group I (Alkali metals) increases down the group. It has nothing to do with how much you are using so even if you add 0.1g of potassium and 1g of lithium to cold water, potassium being more reactive than lithium will react more violently than lithium.\nIt has to do with the electronic configuration. Group I metals tend to give away their 1 valence electron to attain stability with full octet (or duplet for lithium). As you go further down the Group, the atoms get bigger (more shells) and the valence electron gets further away from the attractive force of the nucleus (nucleus contains positively charged protons and neutral neutrons hence nucleus are overall, positively charged. Electrons are negatively charged hence there is a force of attraction between the nucleus and the electrons). Hence it becomes easier for the atom to lose that valence electron to form a stable configuration and the ease of giving away that valence electron translates to mean more reactive and finally, more violent, vigorously, explosively reaction down the group of alkali metals.\n\nHope this helps :)",science_mathematics

"how many blood types are in a humanbody?  Humans have the following blood types along with their respective antigens and antibodies:\n\n    * Individuals with type A blood have red blood cells with antigen A on their surface and produce antibodies against antigen B in their blood serum. Therefore an A-negative person can only receive blood from another A-negative person or from an O-negative person.\n    * Individuals with type B blood have the opposite arrangement, antigen B on their cells and produce antibodies against antigen A in their serum. Therefore, a B-negative person can only receive blood from another B-negative person or from an O-negative person.\n    * Individuals with type AB blood have red blood cells with both antigens A and B and do not produce antibodies against either antigen in their serum. Therefore, a person with type AB-positive blood can safely receive any ABO type blood and is called a ""universal receiver"". However an AB-positive person cannot donate blood except to another AB-positive person.\n    * Individuals with type O blood have red blood cells with neither antigen but produce antibodies against both types of antigens. Therefore, a person with type O-negative blood can safely donate to a person with any ABO blood type and is called a ""universal donor"". However an O-negative person can only receive blood from another O-negative person.\n\nOverall, the O blood type is the most common blood type in the world, although in some areas, such as Sweden and Norway, the A group dominates. The A antigen is overall more common than the B antigen. Since the AB blood type requires the presence of both A and B antigens, the AB blood type is the rarest of the ABO blood types. There are known racial and geographic distributions of the ABO blood types. \n\nThe precise reason why people develop antibodies against an antigen they have never been exposed to is unknown. It is believed that some bacterial antigens are similar enough to the A and B glycoproteins, and that antibodies created against the bacteria will react to ABO-incompatible blood cells.\n\nApart from red blood cells, the ABO antigen is also expressed on the glycoprotein von Willebrand factor (vWF), which participates in hemostasis (control of bleeding). In fact, blood type O predisposes very slightly to bleeding, as vWF is degraded more rapidly. ABO antigens are also present in many other tissues such as liver, kidneys and lungs\n\nThe H antigen:\nThe A & B antigens are derived from a common precursor known as the H antigen. The H antigen is a glycosphingolipid (sphingolipid with carbohydrates bonded to the ceramide moiety) which is modified to produce the A and B antigens. In type O blood, it remains unchanged and consists of a chain of glucose, galactose, N-acetyl galactosamine, and fucose attached to the ceramide. Since it lacks N-acetylneuraminic acid (sialic acid) it is referred to as a globoside, not a ganglioside. Type A has an extra N-acetyl galactosamine bonded to the galactose near the end, while type B has a third galactose bonded to that near-end galactose.",science_mathematics

"history of great kills park?  Great Kills is the name of a neighborhood within New York City's borough of Staten Island. It is located on the island's South Shore, and according to many local geographers, it is the South Shore's northernmost community. Kill is an archaic Dutch word with various popular translations, including ""creek"" and ""channel;"" indeed, many small streams dot the neighborhood, and the name can be interpreted as meaning that a great number of such streams can be found there.\n\nThe eastern half of what is today known as Great Kills was originally named Cairedon, while the western half was referred to as Newtown. Later, both came to be known by the single name of Giffords, after Daniel Gifford, a local commissioner and road surveyor — this name surviving in Giffords Lane, the main north-south thoroughfare in what was formerly called Newtown; the Great Kills station on the Staten Island Railway is at the southern end of this street, in the heart of the community's business district. The present name of Great Kills was informally adopted in 1865. Another former place name associated with the area is Honeywood; its precise origin is uncertain, but it was the name of the telephone exchange that served Great Kills and many other upper South Shore communities from the 1920s through the late 1950s.\n\nAt the southeastern corner of the neighborhood is the Staten Island Unit of the Gateway National Recreation Area, which was formerly known as Great Kills Park, and is often still referred to as such by Staten Islanders today. Immediately to the west of this is a harbor and marina, home of the Great Kills Yacht Club. Many hotels and highly-acclaimed seafood restaurants once dominated the shoreline, but steadily increasing pollution of the nearby waters forced most of them out of business by the middle of the 20th Century; the last surviving shoreline restaurant of note, the Shoals Restaurant, was destroyed in a 1968 arson fire, which also claimed the life of an elderly caretaker who had been living on the premises.\n\nLike many other Staten Island neighborhoods, Great Kills experienced massive population growth in the latter third of the 20th Century, largely catalyzed by the opening of the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge providing easy access from Brooklyn in November of 1964. Many of the new arrivals have been Italian-Americans, and today they constitute the neighborhood's largest ethnic group.\n\nA small city park — named Crescent Beach Park, alluding to the crescent-shaped harbor formed by the peninsula at the south end of the Gateway National Recreation Area — stands at the southeastern corner of the neighborhood. On September 1, 2003 this park was the scene of an alleged hate crime when a visiting African-American girl, her mother and some of her friends became involved in an altercation with some local youths, which turned violent. Eleven neighborhood youths were ultimately indicted on assault and related charges — an incident which underscored the often hostile relations between African-Americans and Italian-Americans in New York City (and many other American cities east of the Mississippi River) that have prevailed since the mid-1960s.\n\nHylan Boulevard between Nelson Avenue and Richmond Avenue has become one of the island's busiest commercial strips; approximately one mile long, the northeastern half of this strip is considered part of Great Kills while the southwestern half is deemed to be in the adjacent ""town"" of Eltingville. Likewise, another border between Great Kills and Eltingville is Armstrong Avenue, with Great Kills on the eastern side of this north-south road.\n\nThe ZIP Code for Great Kills is 10308, and actor Rick Schroder lived in the community as a child",science_mathematics

It will burn as long as there is oxygen present in the right quantities.  The difference is that in gravity, hot air rises.

"Do muscle cells utilize energy  (ATP) on relaxation? According to sliding filament theory, ATP is used for contraction, but whatabout relaxation? When cardiac muscles forcefully relax, do they utilize more energy or ATP? I would like to throw in my two cents to this question. First, in order for actin and myosin to attract, calcium is required. Where does it come from? Well to start a muscle contraction, the neurotransmitter ach must be present at the myoneural junction. Now an action potential will travel down the t-tubules and open gates that allows calcium to leave the sarcoplasmic reticulum . The calcium stored there simply diffuses down its own concentration gradient. Now for the muscle to relax the calcium must be re-stored in the sarcoplasmic reticulum, now it is against its concentration gradient, and it takes ATP energy to put it back. So to answer your question it takes ATP energy to cause muscle contraction and it takes ATP energy to cause muscles to relax. In fact as ATP stores deplete, it takes muscles a longer period of time to relax. I have actually measured this.",science_mathematics

Lucid dreams give us the ability to control our own dreams and steer them toward the direction we want.  In the lucid state, we are more willing to confront threats and as a result, become more self confident.

In fact, some athletes utilize their lucid dreams to practice their tennis serve, golf stroke or bat swing. Even in our day to day life, we can use lucid dreams to ask  the boss for a raise, prepare for a first date, overcome phobias,  get over  writer's block, etc. The application of lucid dreams is limited only to your imagination.  Lucid dreams can help us visualize and rehearse the event in our minds before it actually occurs. \n\nBecause brain activity during the dream state is the same as during a real life event, what you ""learn"" or ""practice"" in your lucid dream state can be seen as training and preparation for the real thing in the waking world.  Our neuronal patterns are already being conditioned.\n\nAt least half of all adults have had at least one lucid dream in their lifetime. Many have reported having lucid dreams without even trying. Often flying is associated with lucid dreams.  However with practice, lucid dreaming can be learned and can be achieved at  your will.",science_mathematics

Good luck.\n\nHere's a short description of Asperger kids (for more, check out the link): \nThey have ...""marked deficiencies in social skills, have difficulties with transitions or changes and prefer sameness. They often have obsessive routines and may be preoccupied with a particular subject of interest. They have a great deal of difficulty reading nonverbal cues (body language) and very often the individual with AS has difficulty determining proper body space. Often overly sensitive to sounds, tastes, smells, and sights, the person with AS may prefer soft clothing, certain foods, and be bothered by sounds or lights no one else seems to hear or see. It's important to remember that the person with AS perceives the world very differently. Therefore, many behaviors that seem odd or unusual are due to those neurological differences and not the result of intentional rudeness or bad behavior...\nBy definition, those with AS have a normal IQ and many individuals (although not all), exhibit exceptional skill or talent in a specific area. Because of their high degree of functionality and their naiveté, those with AS are often viewed as eccentric or odd and can easily become victims of teasing and bullying. While language development seems, on the surface, normal, individuals with AS often have deficits in pragmatics...

"yawning occurs due to excess co2 in body but why is it contagious?and why does it induces sleep?  Causes of yawning\nAn indication of tiredness, stress, over-work or boredom. \nAn action indicating psychological decompression after a state of high alert. \nA means of expressing powerful emotions like anger, rejection or apathy. \nA sign that one is not breathing deeply, and not receiving enough oxygen through the body. \nA yawn can express strong anti-social messages, and so in some cultures people try to mute or mask them by placing a concealing hand over the yawning mouth.\n\n \n\nA long-standing hypothesis is that yawning is caused by an excess of carbon dioxide and lack of oxygen in the blood. The brain stem detects this and triggers the yawn reflex. The mouth stretches wide and the lungs inhale deeply, bringing oxygen into the lungs and hence to the bloodstream. It is almost certain however, that this hypothesis is not correct. One study documented that this effect does not exist (""Yawning"" by Robert R. Provine, pages 532-539, American Scientist, November-December 2005, Vol 93, No. 6). [1]. A more recent hypothesis is that yawning is used for regulation of body temperature. Another hypothesis is that yawns are caused by the same chemicals (neurotransmitters) in the brain that affect emotions, mood, appetite and other phenomena. These chemicals include serotonin, dopamine, glutamic acid and nitric oxide. As more of these compounds are activated in the brain, the frequency of yawning increases. Conversely, a greater presence in the brain of opiate neurotransmitters such as endorphins, reduces the frequency of yawning. Patients taking the serotonin reuptake inhibitor Paxil (Paroxetine HCl) have been observed yawning abnormally often.\n\nAnother theory is that yawning is similar to stretching. Yawning, like stretching, increases blood pressure and heart rate while also flexing many muscles and joints. Some have observed that if you try to stifle or prevent a yawn by clenching your jaws shut, the yawn is unsatisfying. As such, the stretching of jaw and face muscles seems to be necessary for a good yawn.\n\n \nA cockatiel yawningThe yawn reflex is often described as contagious: if one person yawns, this will cause another person to ""sympathetically"" yawn.[2] The reasons for this are unclear; however, recent research suggests that yawning might be a herd instinct.[3] Other theories suggest that the yawn serves to synchronize mood behavior among gregarious animals, similar to the howling of the wolf pack during a full moon. It signals tiredness to other members of the group in order to synchronize sleeping patterns and periods of activity. It can serve as a warning in displaying large, canine teeth, thus proclaiming, ""don't attack while I am sleeping..."" The contagion of yawning is interspecific (i.e., try yawning in front of your dog). Ironically, yawning in public is generally regarded as impolite in the West, but came into fashion in polite French society for a brief period in the late 18th century. Oddly, sometimes sympathetic yawning may be caused by simply looking at a picture of a person or animal yawning, or even seeing the word ""yawn"".\n\nAdelie Penguins employ yawning as part of their courtship ritual. Penguin couples face off and the males engage in what is described as an ""ecstatic display,"" their beaks open wide and their faces pointed skyward.",science_mathematics

"How is crude oil formed?  Crude oil is formed from accumulations of small organisms, mostly phytoplankton and zooplanton that are buried in sediments in both marine and lacustrine (fresh water) environments. Other organic material is mixed in such as spores, pollen, woody material, and other material such as fecal pellets from marine organisms. These materials often settle through the water into an organic-rich mud that is very low in oxygen (anaerobic) so there are few organisms to feed on the material  and it accumulates over long periods of time. Rivers contribute to this process by both delivering large quantities of organic matter, and also large amounts of sediment to bury this organic matter. \n\nOver time these clay-rich sediments are buried under thousands of feet of sediments, dewatered by pressure from the overlying sediment and become shale. As the shale is buried its temperature increases due to geothermal warming. When it reaches temperatures and pressures of 140 degrees F. (60 C) it begins to convert to oil. As temperature increases from continuing burial processes it reachs a temperature where it begins to form natural gas. Both the oil and the gas are gradually expelled from the shale. Typically shales are found in depostional settings where they may be interbedded with sandstones. Sandstones will have higher porosity (more and bigger holes) than shale and the oil and gas will displace salt water that is remaining in the sandstones. Eventually the oil and gas migrates upward through the water and if the overlying structure has formed some sort of a trapping configuration, (like a sandstone overlain by an impervious shale, or a fault that has created a seal against the sandstone, then this becomes an oil reservoir. \n\nA very similar process occurs in carbonate rocks, like limestone and dolomite, except the organic material originates within the carbonate rock in many instances. If the carbonate reef (for example) has been buried by an impervious layer of shale or carbonate mud of a sabkha, it  will become an oil reservoir.  In other instances, the source of the oil will be a shale that is below the carbonate rocks, and the oil will migrate upward into this reservoir.",science_mathematics

"can anybody will explain what is john-teller effect in general? i want to know abt. john teller effect. It's Jahn-Teller effect, not John Teller.\n\nJahn-Teller distortions occur for transition metal complexes where by distortion of the molecule can result in a lower energy state for the molecule.\n\nIn transition metal chemistry, bonds from ligands to the central metal atom are coordinate covalent, i.e. both electrons come from one atom.  The orbitals which contain those electrons bond with usually the dz2 and dx2-y2 orbitals from the metal, but are lower in energy, so the orbitals based on the metal are essentially anti-bonding orbitals.  The dxz, dyz, and dxy orbitals are mostly non-bonding orbitals, but their energies do go up somewhat upon bonding interaction.  In a typical octahedral bonding arrangement, the dz2 and dx2-y2 are degenate, as are the dxz, dyz, and dxy orbitals (they have the same energy).  In certain electron configurations (the classic example is d9), if the system can make those orbitals non-degenerate by lengthening or shortening bonding interactions along a certain axis, it can lower the overall energy by putting electrons in lower energy orbitals, which is why you will often see Cu2+ complexes where some bond distances are longer than others.",science_mathematics

The book was ""at rest"" -- an object tends to stay at rest unless acted on by an external force (that's inertia).

"What is the difference in philosophy and psychology?  Psychology is an academic and applied field involving the study of the mind, brain, and behavior, both human and nonhuman. Psychology also refers to the application of such knowledge to various spheres of human activity, including problems of individuals' daily lives and the treatment of mental illness. \nPsychology differs from sociology, anthropology, economics, and political science in part because it involves studying the mental processes and behavior of individuals (alone or in groups) rather than the behavior of the groups or aggregates themselves. Psychology differs from biology and neuroscience in that it is primarily concerned with the interaction of mental processes and behavior and of the overall processes of a system, and not simply the biological or neural processes themselves, though the subfield of neuropsychology combines the study of the actual neural processes with the study of the mental effects they subjectively produce.\n\n\nPhilosophy is a field of study that includes diverse subfields such as aesthetics, epistemology, ethics, logic, and metaphysics, in which people ask questions such as whether God exists, whether knowledge is possible, and what makes actions right or wrong. The fundamental method of philosophy is the use of reasoning to evaluate arguments concerning these questions. However, the exact scope and methodology of philosophy is not rigid. What counts as philosophy is itself debated, and it varies across philosophical traditions.\n\nThe term philosophy comes from the Greek word ""Φιλοσοφία"" (philo-sophia), which means ""love of wisdom"". The term is notoriously difficult to define (see definition of philosophy) because of the diverse range of ideas that have been labeled as a philosophy. The Penguin Dictionary of Philosophy defines it as the study of ""the most fundamental and general concepts and principles involved in thought, action, and reality"". The Penguin Encyclopedia says that philosophy differs from science in that philosophy's questions cannot be answered empirically, and from religion in that philosophy allows no place for faith or revelation. However, these points are called into question by the Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy, which states: ""the late 20th-century... prefers to see philosophical reflection as continuous with the best practice of any field of intellectual enquiry."" Indeed, many of the speculations of early philosophers in the field of natural philosophy eventually formed the basis for modern scientific explanations on a variety of subjects.\n\nInformally, a ""philosophy"" may refer to a general world view or to a specific ethic or belief",science_mathematics

Major research efforts in the field include sequence alignment, gene finding, genome assembly, protein structure alignment, protein structure prediction, prediction of gene expression and protein-protein interactions, and the modeling of evolution.\n\nThe terms bioinformatics and computational biology are often used interchangeably, although the former typically focuses on algorithm development and specific computational methods, while the latter focuses more on hypothesis testing and discovery in the biological domain.

Gamma distribution\nWeibull distribution\nCauchy distribution\nBeta distribution\nThe hazard rate (failure rate) in exponential distribution\n\nI've been trying to understand the book but all the parameter-speak have been rather counter intuitive and I find them real hard to understand. Gamma distribution\n\nA gamma distribution is a general type of statistical distribution that is related to the beta distribution and arises naturally in processes for which the waiting times between Poisson distributed events are relevant. \n\nBeta Distribution\nA general type of statistical distribution which is related to the gamma distribution. Beta distributions have two free parameters, which are labeled according to one of two notational conventions. \n\nWeibull distribution\nThe Weibull distribution gives the distribution of lifetimes of objects. It was originally proposed to quantify fatigue data, but it is also used in analysis of systems involving a ""weakest link."" \n\nCauchy distribution\nThe Cauchy distribution, also called the Lorentzian distribution or Lorentz distribution, is a continuous distribution describing resonance behavior. It also describes the distribution of horizontal distances at which a line segment tilted at a random angle cuts the x-axis. \n\nexponential distribution\nThe exponential distribution is the only continuous memoryless random distribution. It is a continuous analog of the geometric distribution. \n\nPLease also reffere to link, its useful\nhttp://www.statsoft.com/textbook/stdisfit.html",science_mathematics

"What are blueprints, and why are they blue?  ""blueprints"" came from the machine that was once used to reproduce original pen and ink construction plans. The device was called a Blu Ray. It used a reaction caused by amonia to transfer a copy from the original. If you have ever seen an OLD set of blueprints/construction plans you would see the obvious answer to you rquestion.",science_mathematics

"can somebody help me find a web site about a research on VOLUMETRIC ANALYSIS & ITS APPLICATIONS ? it' s a branch of inorganic chemistry , quatitative analysis, I'm studying the basic course. If you enter VOLUMETRIC ANALYSIS on yahoo then you get a plethora of different sites, everything from formulas to well a lot more than we can go into here.\nTry it I think it will meet your needs. I just changed the search parameters to ""+VOLUMETRIC ANALYSIS"" ANALYSIS APPLICATIONS, they to were very interesting. In fact I found your question in there!!!",science_mathematics
how lizards loose their tails?  This guy is WRONG!!!  MOST lizards lose their tail as a defensive mechanism.  They do this by breaking a plane in the tail that contains very few blood vessels.,science_mathematics
What is the main factor which prevents space scientists to send a man to the Mars?  One unsolved issue is cosmic rays. Astronauts traveling through space for an entire year will have their DNA pretty much trashed--fatal radiation dose. It's not much better on the Martian surface as the atmosphere is not thick enough to prevent bombardment.,science_mathematics
